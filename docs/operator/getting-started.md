# Getting Started with CoNexus

Welcome to CoNexus! This guide will take you from installation to your first successful multi-agent collaboration workflow.

## 📋 Prerequisites

### Required Knowledge
- **Basic programming experience** (any language)
- **Command line familiarity** (basic terminal commands)
- **Git basics** (clone, commit, push)
- **AI assistant experience** (Claude Code, Cursor, or similar)

### Required Software
- **Rust** (stable toolchain) — the backend/router implementation
- **Node.js 22+** with npm — the dashboard
- **Nix** with flakes enabled — the real production deployment path
  (systemd units, per-project process management); also the easiest
  way to build everything below without hand-managing flags
- **Git** for version control
- **AI Coding Assistant** (Claude Code recommended)

### Recommended Setup
- **VS Code** with SQLite Viewer extension
- **Terminal multiplexer** (tmux or similar)
- **OpenAI API key** for embeddings (or the bundled local Ollama
  default — see "Environment variables" below)

---

## ⚡ Quick Install

The original Python implementation's standalone single-process mode
(`uv run -m agent_mcp.cli`) doesn't have a direct Rust equivalent —
`conexus-backend` is deliberately UDS-only and reachable through
`conexus-router`'s proxy in every real deployment, matching the
architecture the production Nix/home-manager module actually runs.
The realistic quick path is therefore through Nix, which builds and
wires all three pieces (router, backend, dashboard) the same way the
real deployment does:

### 1. Clone and build
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dvaerum/CoNexus.git
cd CoNexus

nix build .#conexus-backend -o result-backend      # the per-project backend binary
nix build .#conexus-router -o result-router        # the always-on router binary
nix build .#agent-mcp-dashboard -o result-dashboard  # the dashboard static export
```

`conexus-cli` (used below for `migrate`) has no Nix flake output —
build it with Cargo instead: `cargo build --release -p conexus-cli`
from `rust/` produces `rust/target/release/conexus-cli`. The Rust
binaries alone (`conexus-backend`/`conexus-router`/`conexus-cli`, and
any of the other `rust/` workspace crates) can likewise be built with
`cargo build --release` for local development without Nix — but
`cargo` cannot build the dashboard; that's always the separate `npm
run build` step in `agent_mcp/dashboard/` (or the `nix build
.#agent-mcp-dashboard` above). See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full build/test loop.

### 2. Register a project and start the router
```bash
# A project registry is a JSON file mapping project name -> workspace path.
echo '{"my-project": "/path/to/your/project"}' > projects.json

# Apply the schema-authority baseline to the project's own DB.
mkdir -p /path/to/your/project/.agent
rust/target/release/conexus-cli migrate /path/to/your/project

./result-router/bin/conexus-router \
  --port 5454 \
  --projects-file projects.json \
  --sock-dir /tmp/agent-mcp-sockets \
  --dashboard-dir ./result-dashboard/share/agent-mcp-dashboard
```

The router lazily starts `conexus-backend` for a project on its first
request (spawning it against the matching entry in `--projects-file`)
and stops it again after `--idle-sec` (default 4h) of inactivity — you
don't start the backend directly.

### 3. First-boot operator login

See "First-boot setup (operator login)" below — the router creates
the first operator account on its own first boot.

### 4. Connect AI Assistant

After provisioning a per-agent token from the dashboard (see
[`docs/integrations/external-mcp-client.md`](../integrations/external-mcp-client.md)),
add to your `mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "CoNexus": {
      "url": "http://localhost:5454/conexus/mcp/<project>",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <per-agent-token>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**You're ready!** The server is running and your AI assistant can connect.

---

## First-boot setup (operator login)

As of v5.0.59 the dashboard requires operator login (Phase 1 of the
operator-login plan; ADR-0013). The agent-side MCP transport
(`/conexus/mcp/<project>`) is unchanged — agents authenticate with
their per-agent token via the `Authorization: Bearer` header. Only
the dashboard surface uses cookie sessions.

> **Note (2026-06-23, `retire-system-token` complete after Wave 5,
> PRs #208 / #209 / #210 / #211 / Wave 5):** the project-wide
> `admin_token` / `system_token` no longer exists. External MCP
> clients (Claude Code, IDE plugins, ad-hoc scripts) must
> **provision a per-agent worker or manager agent in the dashboard
> and use that agent's `token` as the bearer.** See
> [`docs/integrations/external-mcp-client.md`](../integrations/external-mcp-client.md) for the
> walkthrough.

Pick the bootstrap path that matches your deploy shape:

### Wizard (browser, easiest)

```bash
# Start the router (multi-tenant), then browse to the dashboard.
conexus-router --port 5454
# Open http://localhost:5454/conexus/
```

The empty-users state redirects you to `/conexus/setup`. Pick a
username + password; that account becomes the first operator and
inherits membership in every existing project.

### Env vars (NixOS, Docker, declarative deploys)

```bash
export CONEXUS_BOOTSTRAP_USERNAME="dennis"
# Pass the password via a sops-decrypted env file or systemd
# `EnvironmentFile=` — anything that doesn't leak into the
# command line / `ps`-readable args.
export CONEXUS_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD="$(cat /run/secrets/agent-mcp-bootstrap-pw)"
conexus-router --port 5454
```

The router creates the first operator on startup, then unsets both
env vars in-process so they don't leak into spawned backend
subprocesses (per agent.create_user → init_router_db).

### CLI (ops fallback, subsequent operators)

```bash
# Interactive password prompt:
conexus-cli router create-operator --username alice

# Non-interactive (piped):
echo "$NEW_PW" | conexus-cli router create-operator \
    --username alice --password-stdin
```

After first boot, log in at `http://localhost:5454/conexus/login`.
The session cookie is `conexus_session=<opaque>; HttpOnly; Secure;
SameSite=Lax; Path=/conexus/`. Sessions live 30 days idle, sliding
on every dashboard request; revoke immediately with a SQL `DELETE
FROM sessions WHERE user_id = ...` against `router.db` (no
`conexus-cli` subcommand for this exists yet — `router create-operator`
and `router migrate` are the only two `router`-scoped subcommands
today; don't confuse the latter with the plain top-level `migrate`
used above, which operates on a project's own database, not `router.db`).

## Environment variables

CoNexus defaults are designed to work out of the box — none of the
following are required. The provider switch is presence/absence of a
non-empty `OPENAI_API_KEY` (see
[`rust/conexus-tools/src/embedding_client.rs`](../../rust/conexus-tools/src/embedding_client.rs)/
[`completion_client.rs`](../../rust/conexus-tools/src/completion_client.rs)
for the exact resolution rules) — it is NOT auto-seeded to any value;
unset (or empty) means the local-Ollama branch.

| Variable                          | Default (unset `OPENAI_API_KEY`, i.e. Ollama) | Default (`OPENAI_API_KEY` set, i.e. OpenAI) | Notes |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`                  | unset                                          | (required — this is the switch)              | Set to a real OpenAI key to use the cloud; leave unset for local Ollama. |
| `CONEXUS_LLM_BASE_URL`          | `http://localhost:11434/v1`                    | not consulted                                | Chat + embedding endpoint override, Ollama path only. |
| `OLLAMA_MODEL`                    | `qwen3:1.7b`                                   | not consulted                                | Chat-completions model, Ollama path only. |
| `OPENAI_BASE_URL`                 | not consulted                                  | `https://api.openai.com/v1`                  | Chat + embedding endpoint override, OpenAI path only. |
| `OPENAI_MODEL`                    | not consulted                                  | **required, no default** — a missing value is a hard config error | Chat-completions model, OpenAI path only. |
| `CONEXUS_EMBEDDING_MODEL`       | `qwen3-embedding:0.6b`                         | `text-embedding-3-large`                     | RAG embedding model; an explicit value overrides either branch's default. |
| `CONEXUS_EMBEDDING_DIMENSION`   | `1024`                                         | `1536`                                       | Must match the embedding model; an explicit value overrides either branch's default. |
| `MCP_PROJECT_DIR`                 | (set by `--project-dir`)                       | (set by `--project-dir`)                     | **Advanced.** The CLI sets this from `--project-dir`. Schema authority is `sea-orm-migration`, not Alembic — see `rust/conexus-db/src/migration/mod.rs`'s module doc for the migration model. |

Pre-v5.0.53 wirings used a `.env.example` checked into the repo
referencing `MCP_SERVER_URL` and `MCP_ADMIN_TOKEN`. Both are
**removed**: `MCP_SERVER_URL` is no longer read, and the project-wide
"admin token" was retired entirely (`retire-system-token`,
PRs #208 / #209 / #210 / #211 / Wave 5). Per-agent bearer tokens
have taken its place — provision a worker or manager agent in the
dashboard ("Create Agent" panel) and use that row's `token` to
authenticate external MCP clients. See
[`docs/integrations/external-mcp-client.md`](../integrations/external-mcp-client.md) for the
walkthrough.

A handful of legacy `--admin-token-*` / `--system-token-*` CLI flags
existed transitionally between Phase 2 Wave 1b and `retire-system-
token` Wave 3; they're all gone. Spawned agents receive their token
via the `MCP_AGENT_TOKEN` env var stamped into the tmux session by
`create_agent` — no global token file is written anywhere.

## 🎯 Your First Multi-Agent Project

Let's build a simple task management system to demonstrate CoNexus's capabilities.

### Step 1: Create Your Project Directory
```bash
mkdir my-task-manager
cd my-task-manager

# Initialize basic structure
touch README.md
mkdir src docs tests
```

### Step 2: Create Your First MCD

Create `MCD.md` in your project root:

```markdown
# Task Manager MCD

## 🎯 Overview & Goals  
**Project Vision**: Build a simple task management web application where users can create, update, and delete tasks with a clean, responsive interface.

**Target Users**: Individual users who need a simple, distraction-free task tracker

**Core Features**: 
1. Create tasks with title and description
2. Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
3. Delete tasks
4. Responsive web interface
5. Local storage persistence

**Success Criteria**: 
- Users can add a task in under 5 seconds
- Task status updates are immediate
- Interface works on mobile and desktop
- No data loss on page refresh

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture
**Frontend**: 
- Vanilla JavaScript (no framework complexity)
- HTML5 with semantic structure
- CSS3 with Flexbox/Grid for responsive design
- LocalStorage for data persistence

**Backend**: 
- None required (client-side only for simplicity)
- Future: Node.js + Express for multi-user features

**APIs**: 
- LocalStorage API for data persistence
- Future: REST API for server features

**Technology Justification**: 
- Vanilla JS for simplicity and learning
- LocalStorage for immediate functionality without backend complexity
- Responsive design for universal accessibility

## 📋 Detailed Implementation

### Data Structure
```javascript
// Task object structure
interface Task {
  id: string;          // UUID for unique identification
  title: string;       // Required, max 100 characters
  description: string; // Optional, max 500 characters  
  completed: boolean;  // Task completion status
  createdAt: Date;     // Creation timestamp
  updatedAt: Date;     // Last modification timestamp
}

// Storage structure
const tasks = []; // Array of Task objects in localStorage
```

### Core Functions

## ✅ Task Breakdown & Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Structure (30 minutes)
**1.1 HTML Foundation**
- Create semantic HTML structure with proper accessibility
- Include meta tags for responsive design
- **Acceptance**: HTML validates and displays correctly

**1.2 CSS Styling**
- Implement responsive layout with Flexbox
- Create clean, modern styling with good contrast
- **Acceptance**: Interface looks good on mobile and desktop

### Phase 2: JavaScript Functionality (45 minutes)
**2.1 Data Management**
- Implement localStorage utilities for data persistence
- Create task CRUD operations
- **Acceptance**: Tasks persist across page refreshes

**2.2 User Interface**
- Implement task creation form handling
- Create dynamic task list rendering
- Add task completion toggle functionality
- **Acceptance**: All core features work without errors

### Phase 3: Polish (15 minutes)
**3.1 User Experience**
- Add form validation and user feedback
- Implement keyboard shortcuts (Enter to add task)
- **Acceptance**: Interface is intuitive and responsive

## 🔗 Integration & Dependencies
**Internal Dependencies**: 
- app.js depends on storage.js and utils.js
- All JS files depend on DOM structure in index.html

**External Dependencies**: 
- None (vanilla JavaScript only)

## 🧪 Testing & Validation Strategy
**Manual Testing**:
- Create task and verify it appears
- Mark task complete and verify status change
- Delete task and verify removal
- Refresh page and verify persistence
- Test on mobile device for responsiveness

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All CRUD operations work correctly
- Data persists across browser sessions
- No JavaScript errors in console
- Interface is fully responsive
```

### Step 3: Provision a Manager Agent and Initialize It

In the dashboard's **Create Agent** panel, create an agent with the
role `manager` (call it `mgr` or similar). Copy its `token` from the
agents list. In your AI assistant (Claude Code/Cursor), use that
token to initialize the manager session:

```
You are the manager agent for the Task Manager project.
Agent Token: "<your_manager_token_from_the_dashboard>"

TASK: Add the entire MCD to project context - every detail, don't summarize anything.

[Paste your complete MCD here]

After adding context, create a worker agent to start implementation.
```

See [`docs/integrations/external-mcp-client.md`](../integrations/external-mcp-client.md) for
the full client-config setup (downloading `.mcp.json`, headers,
multi-tenant vs single-tenant URL shape).

### Step 4: Create Worker Agent

When the manager agent creates a worker, copy that worker's `token`
from the dashboard's agents list and initialize it in a new window:

```
You are frontend-worker agent.
Your Agent Token: "<worker_token_from_the_dashboard>"

Look at your assigned tasks and ask the project RAG agent 5-7 critical questions to understand:
- What exactly needs to be implemented
- What file structure to use  
- How the task management functionality should work

Think critically about each question before asking.

AUTO --worker --memory
```

### Step 5: Watch the Magic Happen

The worker agent will:
1. ✅ Query the project RAG for context
2. ✅ Review its assigned tasks  
3. ✅ Create the HTML structure
4. ✅ Implement CSS styling
5. ✅ Build JavaScript functionality
6. ✅ Test the implementation
7. ✅ Update task status and document progress

### Step 6: Review and Iterate

Use the dashboard to:
- 📊 Monitor agent progress in real-time
- 📋 Track task completion
- 🧠 View project context and agent communications
- 🔍 Debug any issues that arise

## 🎓 Learning Path

### After Your First Project
1. **Study the MCD** - Review how it guided the agent's work
2. **Explore the Dashboard** - Understand the visualizations
3. **Try Variations** - Modify the MCD and see how agents adapt
4. **Join Community** - Share your experience and learn from others

### Next Steps
1. **[The Complete MCD Guide](../mcd-example/mcd-guide.md)** - Master MCD creation
2. **[Example MCD](../mcd-example/README.md)** - Study a worked example
3. **[Connecting external MCP clients](../integrations/external-mcp-client.md)** - Wire Claude Code / IDE plugins / scripts to a project

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Cannot find admin token"
**Solution**: The project-wide admin token was retired in PRs
#208–#211. Provision a per-agent token from the dashboard
instead — see
[`docs/integrations/external-mcp-client.md`](../integrations/external-mcp-client.md).

### "Agent can't access project context"
**Solution**: Make sure the manager agent successfully added the MCD to project context. Check the dashboard's Memory section.

### "Worker agent doesn't understand tasks"
**Solution**: Your MCD might be too vague. Add more specific implementation details and acceptance criteria.

### "Agents are not coordinating"
**Solution**: Ensure each agent is initialized with its own per-agent token from the dashboard's `agents` table and the `--worker` flag is included in worker initialization.

### ❌ "Dashboard won't load"
**Solution**: 
```bash
# Check Node.js version (needs 22+)
node --version  

# Reinstall dependencies in dashboard directory
cd agent_mcp/dashboard
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run dev
```

### ❌ "MCP server connection failed"
**Solution**: Verify the router is running on the correct port and that your AI assistant can reach `http://localhost:5454/conexus/mcp/<project-name>` (the per-project MCP endpoint, proxied through the router — `conexus-backend` has no direct client-facing port of its own).
