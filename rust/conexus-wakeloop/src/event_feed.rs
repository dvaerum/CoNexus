//! The `wait_for_events`/`fetch_events_since` event-feed pipeline. Port
//! of the pure/stateless half of `conexus/tools/agent_communication_
//! tools.py`'s helpers feeding `assemble_event_feed` (the DB-reading
//! collectors and the full pipeline assembly land in later PRs, per the
//! Phase D3 research report's suggested 3-PR sequence).
//!
//! An event is a plain JSON object (`serde_json::Value`), matching
//! Python's `Dict[str, Any]` shape exactly: `{"type", "ref_id",
//! "timestamp", "payload"}` (or `"data"` for a couple of legacy event
//! shapes `_event_priority_rank` also reads) -- there is no fixed struct
//! because event PAYLOAD shape genuinely varies by `type` (a message
//! event's payload looks nothing like a `stop_listening` event's), and
//! `conexus-tools`' own `Tool::call` boundary already speaks
//! `serde_json::Value` for the same reason (untyped tool arguments).
//!
//! ## `_dedup_events`/`_event_identity` deliberately NOT ported
//!
//! Python's `_dedup_events` exists only because two producers can
//! describe the SAME logical event: a DB re-query (`_collect_
//! unassigned_task_events_for`, timestamped by the row's real
//! `updated_at`) and a synthetic in-memory queue push
//! (`state.dispatch_synthetic_event`, timestamped by wall-clock
//! `now()`) for the identical underlying row. Without dedup, merging
//! both delivers the same task twice per envelope.
//!
//! `conexus-wakeloop::waiter_registry`'s `WakeSignal` is payload-less BY
//! DESIGN (see that module's own doc comment, which independently
//! verified this exact same invariant from `assemble_event_feed`'s own
//! docstring: the DB re-query alone is always sufficient for
//! correctness, so the synthetic push is a latency optimization, not a
//! correctness requirement). A Rust `assemble_event_feed` built on top
//! of `WaiterRegistry` therefore only ever wakes with a bare signal and
//! re-derives EVERY event stream from the DB on every wake -- there is
//! never a second, differently-timestamped copy of the same row to
//! collide with. `_dedup_events` would be dead code here: a `HashMap`
//! keyed by `(type, ref_id)` that could only ever see each key once.
//! This is a design decision made explicit here, not a silent gap --
//! revisit it ONLY if a future change reintroduces a payload-carrying
//! wake channel.
//!
//! ## Phase G: sea-orm lands in `assemble_event_feed`, one collector
//! at a time
//!
//! [`assemble_event_feed`] is `async fn` and takes a `&sea_orm::
//! DatabaseConnection` alongside its legacy `conn: &AsyncMutex<
//! Connection>` (async plumbing settled by a prerequisite PR, #975,
//! before any collector was actually converted -- see the module-level
//! comment near `AsyncMutex`'s Phase D1/D2/D3 precedent in
//! `conexus_auth::tool` for the `!Send`-future hazard that plumbing
//! avoids). [`collect_pending_pokes_for`] was the first collector
//! flipped to sea-orm, reading `sea_orm_db` via
//! `pending_directive_repository`; [`collect_scheduled_directive_events_for`]
//! is the second, reading/writing `sea_orm_db` via
//! `scheduled_directive_repository::collect_due_and_fire`. Its
//! `agent_actions` audit-log side effect ALSO now writes through
//! `sea_orm_db` (`agent_action_repository`'s own conversion), so this
//! collector no longer takes a `&Connection`/`&AsyncMutex<Connection>`
//! parameter at all. [`collect_events_with_cap`] and
//! [`collect_unassigned_task_events_for`] are the third/fourth,
//! `task_repository`'s own PR2, and take a `&AsyncMutex<Connection>`
//! -- NOT a bare `&Connection`, even though each function's own
//! `Connection`-touching work (message/agent-gate reads) finishes
//! well before its own `task_repository`-via-`sea_orm_db` `.await`.
//! This is a real, empirically-verified Rust constraint worth stating
//! plainly: unlike a `MutexGuard<Connection>` LOCAL (safe to hold
//! across an `.await` because `MutexGuard<Connection>: Send`, since
//! `Connection: Send` even though `!Sync`), a bare `&Connection`
//! PARAMETER poisons an `async fn`'s returned future's `Send`ness
//! UNCONDITIONALLY the moment the body references it ANYWHERE --
//! including strictly before the function's own first `.await` point.
//! This is NOT the same rule as "a value held live across a
//! suspension must be `Send`": an async fn's own parameters are
//! captured into its generated future's environment the same way a
//! closure captures its upvars (eagerly, at the point the future
//! value is constructed, independent of internal control flow), so
//! "last real use before the await" -- the rule that correctly governs
//! a LOCAL `MutexGuard` -- does NOT rescue a non-Send PARAMETER TYPE.
//! Each of these two functions therefore locks `conn` itself,
//! internally, in its own short-lived scope around ONLY its
//! synchronous work, dropping the guard before its own `.await` --
//! the "receive the whole mutex, lock fresh, drop before your own
//! `.await`" idiom, not the "receive an already-locked `&Connection`"
//! shape those two functions had before this conversion.
//! `collect_agent_profile_events_for` is still fully legacy rusqlite
//! (untouched, still takes a bare `&Connection` -- it has no `.await`
//! in its own body, so the constraint above doesn't apply to it),
//! locked fresh by `assemble_event_feed` itself right before that one
//! call. A future batch PR flips the remaining collector one at a
//! time without touching this function's signature again.
