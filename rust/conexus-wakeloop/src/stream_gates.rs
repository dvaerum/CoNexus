//! Streaming-lifecycle revalidation seam. Port of
//! `conexus/core/stream_gates.py` (Finding N5).
//!
//! Python's module doc explains WHY this exists: four long-lived
//! streams each hand-rolled the same "re-check, bounded wait, re-check
//! again after the dequeue" loop under a different finding ID, and the
//! half that kept getting dropped when the pattern was copied by hand
//! was specifically the SECOND re-check (the one after the dequeue,
//! before the item reaches the caller) -- SEC-B-F2 found exactly that
//! omission once. [`RevalidatingStream::next_slice`] fuses the two into
//! one call: the ONLY place a queue is ever dequeued is here, and both
//! exits (a real item, or an idle timeout) run a fresh liveness check
//! before handing anything back. A revoked stream is a hard error
//! ([`StreamRevoked`]), not a value a caller could forget to inspect.
//!
//! `conexus-tools::agent_communication_tools::WaitForEventsTool` is
//! this crate's first real consumer; the port is written generically (over
//! the item type and the liveness/cadence closures) so a future
//! SSE-style stream can reuse it too, matching Python's own four-streams
//! design even though only one of those streams has a Rust home so far.
//!
//! ## What's fused, and what's deliberately NOT (same split as Python)
//!
//! Fused: the bounded wait (clamped so a slice can never outlast the
//! stream's own cadence -- a caller's `timeout` can only shorten one
//! slice, never lengthen it), the post-dequeue liveness re-check before
//! the item is handed back, the post-idle-expiry re-check before the
//! caller's idle-branch work runs, and fail-closed teardown as an error
//! type rather than a flag.
//!
//! NOT fused: the liveness predicate itself (different streams have
//! genuinely different staleness/cost characteristics -- a constructor
//! argument, not a policy this module makes) and the cadence (also a
//! constructor argument).
//!
//! ## A wrinkle Python has that this port does NOT inherit
//!
//! Python's own docstring flags a known `asyncio` hazard: `asyncio.
//! wait_for` cancels the inner `queue.get()` on timeout, and a `put`
//! landing in that cancellation window can be dropped. This does NOT
//! apply here: `tokio::sync::mpsc::Receiver::recv` is documented
//! cancel-safe -- "if recv is used as the event in a `tokio::select!`
//! statement and some other branch completes first, it is guaranteed
//! that no messages were removed from this channel." Wrapping it in
//! `tokio::time::timeout` and having it time out does not lose a
//! message; it stays queued for the next `next_slice` call. A genuine
//! improvement from the runtime, not something this port had to build.
