//! The per-agent `wait_for_events` waiter registry. Port of the waiter
//! half of `conexus/core/state.py` (`register_waiter`/
//! `unregister_waiter`/`supersede_prior_waiters`/`notify_waiters`/
//! `dispatch_synthetic_event`).
//!
//! ## Newest-wins, not N-way fan-out (a deliberate simplification,
//! verified against the real behavior -- not guessed)
//!
//! Python's `agent_event_waiters` is a `Dict[str, List[asyncio.Queue]]`
//! -- a LIST per agent, a leftover from ADR-0012's original N-concurrent-
//! waiters design. But `register_waiter` immediately calls
//! `supersede_prior_waiters`, which evicts every OTHER queue in that
//! list the moment a new one registers -- so in practice the list holds
//! more than one live entry only for the instant between those two
//! calls. The Phase D3 research report's own conclusion: "treat 'at
//! most one live waiter per agent, newest wins' as the actual current
//! contract, and the N-way fan-out plumbing... as a leftover mechanism."
//! This registry implements that actual contract directly -- ONE sender
//! per agent, not a list -- rather than porting the vestigial list
//! shape.
//!
//! ## Why the channel only ever carries a bare `Wake` signal, never an
//! event payload
//!
//! Python has two producers: `notify_waiters` (DB-backed events --
//! messages, task changes) pushes a bare sentinel (`None`) purely to
//! release the waiter's `queue.get()`, and `dispatch_synthetic_event`
//! (events with no dedicated event-table row, e.g.
//! `unassigned_task_appeared`) pushes the actual event dict. It looks
//! like the channel needs to carry real payloads for the second case --
//! but `assemble_event_feed`'s own docstring pins BL-R31-2: the
//! synthetic-queue copy and a fresh DB re-query of the same underlying
//! state (`_collect_unassigned_task_events_for`, an unbounded query run
//! on EVERY wake regardless of what woke it) are explicitly DEDUPED
//! against each other, keeping the DB copy. That dedup only makes sense
//! if the DB query alone is already sufficient for correctness -- the
//! synthetic push is a LATENCY optimization (wake sooner than the next
//! poll interval), not a correctness requirement. So a Rust
//! `assemble_event_feed` port that re-derives every relevant event type
//! (DB-backed AND synthesized-from-DB-state) on every wake needs no
//! payload on the channel at all: waking is waking, regardless of which
//! producer caused it. [`WakeSignal::Wake`] intentionally carries no
//! data.
