//! sqlite-vec extension loading — the "gracefully degrade to no-RAG"
//! contract.
//!
//! Faithful in *intent* to `conexus/db/connection.py`'s
//! `check_vss_loadability()`/`is_vss_loadable()` (never panics, a
//! failure to load just means "no RAG on this host"), but the
//! *mechanism* is deliberately re-derived rather than ported at face
//! value, per the migration plan's "Things to explicitly re-derive"
//! guidance: Python dynamically `dlopen`s a shared-library file via
//! `sqlite_vec.load(conn)`, so "present / absent / corrupt" are
//! filesystem conditions there. The Rust `sqlite-vec` crate instead
//! compiles the extension's C source directly into this binary and
//! exposes only a raw `sqlite3_vec_init` symbol, registered
//! process-wide via SQLite's `sqlite3_auto_extension` hook (see that
//! crate's own upstream test) — there is no file on disk to be
//! absent or corrupt. To keep the same three-case contract
//! independently testable without needing a real broken `.so` on
//! disk, the actual entry point is swappable: production code
//! registers the real `sqlite3_vec_init`, tests register fakes that
//! simulate "never registers `vec_version()`" (absent) and "extension
//! init itself fails" (corrupt).
