//! `RestPrincipal` — the typed identity admitted at the backend's
//! `/api` REST door. Port of `agent_mcp/app/rest_principal.py` +
//! `agent_mcp/app/deps.py::require_operator_session`, narrowed to the
//! two doors the operator kept for this port (2026-09-05 decision,
//! `prancy-napping-pie.md` Phase E1): **forwarding-header only** —
//! the per-project backend stays router-DB-blind, exactly like `/mcp`
//! auth. Python's THIRD door (`kind="session"`, an `conexus_session`
//! cookie) is deliberately NOT ported: `deps.py`'s own docstring
//! documents that path performing a LIVE `router.db` lookup
//! (`identity.get_session`/`group_resolver.resolve_user_*`) on every
//! request as "defence in depth for a misconfiguration that bypassed
//! the router middleware" — this backend is UDS-only and reachable
//! only through the router's proxy in every real deployment, so there
//! is no real "bypassed the router" caller to protect here, only
//! Python's own defensive redundancy that would otherwise require a
//! new `router.db` handle this decision explicitly rules out.
//!
//! Why this is a SEPARATE type from `conexus_core::principal::Principal`
//! (same reasoning as Python's module doc): `RestPrincipal` is an
//! ADMISSION record ("which door, what did it prove"); `Principal` is
//! an AUTHORIZATION subject ("what may they do"). The one conversion
//! between them is [`build_dispatch_principal`], mirroring Python's
//! `_dispatch_helpers._build_route_principal`.
//!
//! This distinction is NOT incidental — it is load-bearing for
//! [`is_confirmed_operator_tier`] below, which must answer differently
//! for the SAME forwarding-header admission depending on which
//! predicate asks: `conexus_core::principal::is_confirmed_operator_tier`
//! (the MCP-side, ADR-0025 predicate) confirms a forwarding caller
//! whose signed role is "operator" via its "backend can SEE a resolved
//! operator identity" clause; the REST-side predicate here does NOT,
//! deliberately, matching `agent_mcp/app/routers/composition.py::
//! is_confirmed_operator_tier`'s own documented scope note: even
//! though the same signed role is technically available on the REST
//! admission record, REST's `/api/tokens`/`/api/all-data` secret
//! surfaces don't widen who receives plaintext bearers just because
//! Finding D made the data available — a deliberate policy choice, not
//! a technical gap. Preserved bit-for-bit, not reconciled.
