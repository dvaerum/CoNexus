//! `/api/delivery/*` HTTP-layer identity gate. Port of
//! `conexus/app/routers/delivery.py::require_agent_bearer`.
//!
//! A THIRD `/api` admission shape, distinct from both `/mcp`'s
//! `auth_gate` (admits any valid agent bearer OR forwarding header)
//! and `rest_gate` (admits a forwarding header or an OPERATOR-TIER
//! bearer only, explicitly rejecting a worker bearer) -- this door
//! admits a WORKER's own bearer token, the same one its MCP tools
//! use. `/api/delivery/*` is per-worker fallback-transport plumbing
//! (ADR-0021), not a dashboard surface, so neither existing gate
//! shape fits: mounting it under `rest_gate` would 401 every real
//! caller (a worker bearer), and `auth_gate` also admits the
//! forwarding header, which has no meaning here (this channel is
//! keyed by `agent_id`, which a forwarding-header caller doesn't
//! carry). A standalone, single-purpose gate is the correct shape,
//! not a third branch bolted onto either existing one.
