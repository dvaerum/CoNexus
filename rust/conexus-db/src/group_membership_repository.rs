//! Port of `conexus/router/group_resolver.py` (Phase E2 PR 4,
//! `conexus-router-group-graph`) -- the graph layer on top of
//! `group_membership`: transitive resolution (up AND down), insert-time
//! cycle detection, sysadmin inheritance, project-role resolution, and
//! the group-CRUD functions `sso.py`'s reconcile path needs.
//!
//! `resolve_user_groups` was ported earlier (Phase C) as the one read
//! path `conexus-auth::resolve_capabilities` needed; everything else
//! here was deliberately deferred until "whichever phase eventually
//! ports the router's group-management REST surface" -- that's this
//! phase.
//!
//! Connection ownership: unlike Python's `conn: sqlite3.Connection |
//! None = None` self-opening default, every function here takes an
//! explicit `&Connection` -- this crate's own convention (matching
//! every other repository), not a new decision for this module.
//!
//! `ROLE_TIER`/`role_rank` stay `pub` but local to this module for
//! now (Python's own docstring calls them "the ONE home... other
//! modules read", but `admin_users_api.py`/`router_store.py` aren't
//! ported yet) -- promote to `conexus_core` only once a second real
//! call site needs it, matching this migration's own established
//! "promote a shared primitive once two call sites need it" rule.
//!
//! Lives on the ROUTER DB (`router.db`), same as `group_capability_repository`.
//!
//! **Phase G (sea-orm migration, router step 4 PR G)**: a real
//! call-site classification (every production caller of every
//! function here, traced across `conexus-router` AND `conexus-auth`
//! before any conversion code was written) found the SAME shape PR C/
//! PR D already established, only wider: `resolve_user_groups`/
//! `resolve_user_is_sysadmin`/`resolve_user_project_role` are the hot
//! path `conexus_auth::capabilities::resolve_capabilities` needs
//! (called synchronously from `session_gate.rs::evaluate_session_gate`/
//! `project_gate.rs`'s revalidation functions -- never forced async),
//! and `admin_groups.rs`'s/`admin_group_members.rs`'s mutating
//! `decide_*` functions each run their whole check-then-write sequence
//! inside ONE rusqlite `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction shared with
//! `admin_users_gate.rs`'s (non-`group_membership_repository`) last-
//! sysadmin invariant re-check -- the SAME "a transaction-bound caller
//! gets a sync twin, not a forced conversion to sea-orm's separate
//! connection pool" precedent PR D's own `get_user_public_by_id_in_
//! transaction` already established, just via this crate's own
//! `_sync`-suffix convention instead of `_in_transaction` (no OTHER
//! sea-orm-converted call happens inside these particular
//! transactions, so there's no "reads inside an in-flight uncommitted
//! transaction" distinction to name separately).
//!
//! Functions with a genuine caller on BOTH sides keep BOTH forms
//! (`get_group`/`add_group_member`/`group_member_count`/
//! `list_groups_with_member_counts` -- the async form serves the
//! read-only REST decision layer, `admin_group_capabilities.rs`/
//! `admin_group_members.rs::list_group_members_response`/
//! `admin_groups.rs::list_groups_response`/`oidc_group_mapping.rs`'s
//! now-async claim reconciliation; the `_sync` form serves the
//! transaction-bound `decide_*` functions). Functions whose ONLY real
//! caller turned out to already be async with no transaction
//! constraint (`create_group`, `list_group_members`, `ensure_group`,
//! `is_direct_user_member`, `remove_group_member`,
//! `user_group_memberships_by_name_prefix`) convert wholesale, no
//! `_sync` twin kept. `bootstrap_first_operator_as_sysadmin` has NO
//! real caller at all (a repair-workflow helper ahead of its own
//! consumer, per its own doc below) and converts wholesale too, for
//! the same "nothing left to preserve sync-ness for" reason. Every
//! other function here (`resolve_user_groups`/`resolve_group_ancestors`/
//! `any_group_is_sysadmin`/`resolve_user_is_sysadmin`/
//! `group_is_transitively_sysadmin`/`group_has_transitive_user_member`/
//! `project_roles_for_groups`/`group_resolved_project_roles`/
//! `resolve_user_project_role`/`would_create_cycle`/
//! `update_group_fields`/`delete_group`/`remove_group_member_by_id`,
//! plus the private `ancestors`/`children_of_group` helpers) has ONLY
//! forced-sync real callers (the hot path above, or one of the
//! transaction-bound `decide_*`/`amplification_guard`/
//! `no_sysadmin_would_remain`/`group_resolved_capabilities` functions)
//! and stays untouched rusqlite, unrenamed -- matching `sessions`'
//! own precedent of staying 100% rusqlite when nothing async ever
//! calls it, rather than adding a speculative, uncalled sea-orm form.
//!
//! `oidc_group_mapping.rs` was NOT in this PR's originally-handed-in
//! caller inventory -- found via this PR's own "verify against the
//! real current files" mandate (`ensure_group`/`is_direct_user_member`/
//! `add_group_member`/`user_group_memberships_by_name_prefix`/
//! `remove_group_member`'s only real production caller). Its own only
//! caller, `oidc_handlers.rs`'s ID-token handler, is already async
//! with no hot-path-sync constraint (PR D already established this
//! exact finding for the same handler's `find_or_create_oidc_user`
//! call) -- restructured to release `state.conn`'s rusqlite guard
//! before the (independent, non-transactional) group-mapping step and
//! re-acquire it only for the still-out-of-scope `identity::
//! create_session` call, the same "drop the lock, then do the
//! unrelated async work" shape `lifecycle_rest.rs::
//! create_project_handler` already established for its own post-create
//! membership grant.
