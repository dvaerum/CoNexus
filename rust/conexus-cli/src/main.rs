//! `conexus-cli` -- the operator CLI Python's `conexus.cli` module
//! carries alongside the `server`/`router` leaf commands (both of
//! which stay their own binaries, `conexus-backend`/`conexus-router`,
//! per this migration's Target Architecture; this crate exists for
//! the two remaining standalone operator utilities Python's `cli.py`
//! bundles into the same entry point: `backup` and
//! `router create-operator`).
//!
//! Deliberately NOT a general-purpose wrapper: no `server`/`router`
//! subcommands are re-exposed here (those are `conexus-backend`/
//! `conexus-router`'s own binaries -- duplicating their invocation
//! surface here would just be a second, driftable entry point).
