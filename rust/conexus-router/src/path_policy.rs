//! One canonical home for the router's request-classification facts
//! (N3 Tier 2). Port of `conexus/router/path_policy.py`.
//!
//! Three questions, each answered in exactly one place (see the
//! Python module's own doc for why the two prefix tuples below are
//! deliberately NOT merged into one list -- `UNAUTH_PREFIXES` answers
//! "skip the operator-session gate?", `REDIRECT_EXEMPT_PREFIXES`
//! answers "skip the fresh-install bounce to /setup?" -- their
//! differences are load-bearing, not drift, most visibly at
//! `/conexus/login`/`/conexus/logout`, auth-bypass ONLY, and
//! `/conexus/api/`, redirect-exempt ONLY).
//!
//! **Re-derivation, not a literal port, for the "is this path
//! public?" EXACT-match set**: Python's `public_route`/
//! `derive_public_paths`/`freeze_public_paths` mark a HANDLER at
//! registration time and walk aiohttp's live routing table to derive
//! the exact-match set (so every mechanical alias of a public route --
//! trailing-slash, ADR-0020 root-mount -- inherits the marking for
//! free). axum has no equivalent "walk the registered route table by
//! handler identity" API, and there is no full routing table to walk
//! yet anyway (that's Phase E2 PR 23, app-wiring, necessarily last).
//! This module instead takes the derived exact-path set as an
//! EXPLICIT parameter (`extra_exact_paths`) to [`is_unauth_path`] --
//! the caller (eventually PR 23, which DOES know the real registered
//! routes and their aliases) computes the same set some other way
//! (most naturally: the same small, hand-reviewed table pattern this
//! migration already uses repeatedly for "can't derive automatically,
//! one reviewed list instead" -- `PUBLIC_TOOL_ALLOWLIST`,
//! `TIER_OVERRIDES`, `MUTATING_TOOL_NAMES`). The SAFETY property
//! Python's mechanism protects (R5-F6: exact match, never an unbounded
//! prefix) is preserved either way -- a hand-reviewed exact-match
//! `&[&str]` is exactly as safe against prefix-fallthrough as a
//! runtime-derived one, since axum's own route registration doesn't
//! have the prefix-vs-exact ambiguity the original aiohttp bug came
//! from.
