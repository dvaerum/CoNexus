//! Peer-disconnect vocabulary shared by the router's request paths.
//! Port of `conexus/router/client_disconnect.py` (60 LOC, part of
//! Phase E2 PR 15, `conexus-router-headers-misc`).
//!
//! **`client_is_gone` has no function to port** -- it reads
//! `request.transport.is_closing()`, a live fact only a real
//! `hyper`/`axum` connection can supply (PR 23, app-wiring); this
//! framework-agnostic layer has no transport type yet, so a caller
//! there already HAS the bool this Python function would compute and
//! has no need to call back into a pure function for it. Only the
//! constant + response-shape half is genuinely portable now.
