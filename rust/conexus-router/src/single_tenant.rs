//! Names the two single-tenant authorization policies (arch-r4 #8).
//! Port of `agent_mcp/router/single_tenant.py` (Phase E2 PR 16,
//! `conexus-router-lifecycle-foundations`).
//!
//! Single-tenant mode (ADR-0008) pins a router deploy to one
//! operator-owned host, seeded with exactly one project at install
//! time. That single fact reduces to a one-line boolean
//! (`single_tenant_name.is_some()`) but drives TWO semantically
//! DIFFERENT policies depending on which call site asks -- Python's
//! own docstring argues these are "deliberately contradictory-looking"
//! (one admits through a gate that would otherwise reject; the other
//! rejects a request that would otherwise be admitted) and names them
//! separately so a new call site can't reach for an unnamed `is_some()`
//! by accident. This module is the ONE home for that raw comparison,
//! matching Python's own single-source-of-truth design.
//!
//! **Correction to an earlier PR**: [`bypasses_operator_gate`] was
//! first ported privately inside `session_gate.rs` (PR 12) since that
//! was its only caller at the time. It's re-exported here as the real,
//! shared, top-level module Python's own design calls for -- `perm_gates.py`
//! (folded into this phase's later PRs) and the lifecycle handlers both
//! need it too.
