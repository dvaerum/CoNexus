//! One rule for "does this requester own this task" (port of
//! `conexus/core/task_ownership.py`).
//!
//! Python's module doc explains WHY this got consolidated: before it
//! existed, the rule was reimplemented independently at 5+ call sites
//! and had already drifted into three different shapes (`task_tools.py`:
//! exact `assigned_to == requester` only; `task_comments_tools.py`:
//! widened to also accept `created_by`; `task_queries.py` /
//! `features/rag/query.py`: widened to also accept an unassigned task).
//! Consolidating the CHECK itself — not the widenings, which are
//! genuinely different per call site and stay explicit, opt-in
//! parameters — means a future change to the base rule lands in one
//! place instead of requiring a class-sweep.
//!
//! [`can_access_task`] is the dict-based predicate in Python, for
//! callers that already have the task row (or a partial row with just
//! `assigned_to`/`created_by`) in hand — here it takes the two fields
//! directly rather than a `Mapping`, since every real Rust call site
//! already knows exactly which fields it has (no dict-shaped duck
//! typing needed the way Python's heterogeneous ORM-row/plain-dict
//! callers required). [`sql_fragment`] is the SQL-layer equivalent for
//! callers that scope a query at the DB layer instead of filtering an
//! already-fetched row (`rag/query.py`'s pre-vector-search task-context
//! fetch) — it only expresses the *exact-match* half of the rule (no
//! `include_created_by`/`include_unassigned` widening), since those
//! callers don't need it today.

/// `true` in Python's schema): a task assigned to a DIFFERENT agent is
/// accessible too. Deliberately distinct from `include_unassigned` — an

/// foreign-owned task has a real owner this flag chooses to stop hiding
