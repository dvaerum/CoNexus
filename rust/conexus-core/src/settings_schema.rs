//! Settings-schema registry — the single source of truth for every
//! per-project `config_*` setting (ADR-0018). Faithful, verbatim port
//! of `conexus/core/settings_schema.py`'s `SETTINGS_SCHEMA` tuple.
//!
//! Every registered setting is operator-tier: the `config_*` namespace
//! is writable by any confirmed operator (`Capability::SystemConfigWrite`
//! is the enforcer, ported separately in `conexus-tools`). Per
//! Guiding Principle 4 of the migration plan (`prancy-napping-pie.md`),
//! this stays a hand-written registry consumed by `GET
//! /api/settings-schema`, NOT a `specta`/`ts-rs` derive target — the
//! `specta` pattern this migration uses elsewhere is for domain
//! structs, and extending it here would create a second generated-
//! types pipeline settings could drift from, which ADR-0018 exists
//! specifically to prevent.
//!
//! `default` is [`SettingDefault`], a small const-representable enum,
//! rather than `serde_json::Value` directly (Python's
//! `SettingSpec.default: object` is genuinely heterogeneous across
//! entries -- bool for switches, int for durations) -- `Value` isn't
//! const-constructible, so it can't appear inside the `static` array
//! below; `SettingDefault` serializes to the identical wire shape.
