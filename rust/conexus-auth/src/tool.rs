//! `Tool` trait + type-erased [`ToolDescriptor`] + [`dispatch`].
//!
//! Port of the OTHER half of `conexus/core/authorize.py` +
//! `conexus/tools/registry.py::register_tool`: a `Tool` implementation
//! declares its own name and [`Requirement`] as associated consts —
//! there is no second, decorator-level place for them to drift against
//! (see `crate::requirement`'s module doc).
//!
//! Mechanism note: `const` items aren't dispatchable through `dyn
//! Tool`, so a registry can't return `Vec<&dyn Tool>` the way a more
//! naive design might reach for. [`ToolDescriptor`] is the type-erased
//! shape instead — `name`/`required` copied out of the const, `call` a
//! plain function pointer to the monomorphized impl. `ToolDescriptor::
//! of::<T>()` is `const fn`, so a whole registry can be a `static`
//! array built at compile time, same shape as a hand-written sequence
//! of Python's `register_tool(...)` calls, just collected into a slice
//! instead of executed as side-effecting calls at import time.
//!
//! **The registration list itself (`all_tools()`) does NOT live here.**
//! It moved to `conexus-tools` (the crate one layer up in the
//! workspace dependency direction, see the migration plan's Target
//! Architecture section) the moment a real tool crate existed to hold
//! it — `conexus-auth` sits BELOW `conexus-tools` and must not know
//! tool implementations exist, only the trait/dispatch mechanism they
//! plug into. `all_tools()` briefly lived here as a placeholder before
//! any tool crate existed (Phase C); Phase D1's first real tool port
//! is what surfaced that it was in the wrong crate.
