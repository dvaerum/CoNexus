 * Reconnect catch-up guard.
 *
 * The operator-events hub is fire-and-forget: a mutation published while
 * the dashboard's SSE stream is down (transport drop, router read-timeout,
 * tab hidden→visible reopen, backend restart) reaches zero subscribers
 * and is gone — there is no replay buffer. So on every SUCCESSFUL
 * (re)connect the client must synthesize a `resources/updated` to force a
 * full refetch, reconciling whatever changed during the gap. This pins
 * that behaviour so a future refactor can't silently drop it and leave
 * post-gap changes stale until the slow poll.
