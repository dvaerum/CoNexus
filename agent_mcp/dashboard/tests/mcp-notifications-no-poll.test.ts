/**
 * Contract guard for the operator live-update SSE subscription.
 *
 * History
 * -------
 * The GET /mcp 405-spam loop (verify-all-v8, 2026-06-27): the dashboard
 * subscribed to the agent-scoped ``GET /conexus/mcp/<project>`` with
 * cookie-only auth, which the router rejects with 405 (that GET stream
 * derives ``agent_id`` from a per-agent bearer the cookie can't carry).
 * A user reproduction showed 60+ ``=> 405`` lines within seconds of a
 * project page load. The interim fix turned ``subscribeMcpNotifications``
 * into a no-op so no request fired at all.
 *
 * The real fix is a dedicated cookie-authenticated operator events
 * endpoint (``features/operator_events.py`` + ``GET /api/events``,
 * proxied as ``/conexus/api/<name>/events``). This test now pins the
 * re-wired contract:
 *
 *   1. ``subscribeMcpNotifications()`` opens exactly one stream at mount,
 *      against the operator events endpoint — NOT the ``/mcp`` transport.
 *   2. The fetch carries ``credentials: "include"`` (cookie auth), a GET
 *      method, and an ``Accept: text/event-stream`` header.
 *   3. It returns a callable cleanup that stops the stream cleanly.
 *   4. ``McpNotificationsProvider`` never opens a stream directly — it
 *      only calls ``subscribeMcpNotifications`` (which owns the endpoint
 *      choice + reconnect/visibility lifecycle).

// Imported statically, NOT with an in-test `await import()`.
//
// Why it matters: this module pulls in the data-store, the api client
// and zustand, and Vitest charges module transform + evaluation to
// whichever phase asks for it. Behind an in-test dynamic import the
// whole graph was billed to `testTimeout` — measured at 175ms idle but
// 1.3–3.1s when the box is oversubscribed, i.e. 85%+ of this test's
// wall time was module loading, not the assertion. That is what pushed
// the file over the old 5s budget under parallel load and prompted a
// 5s→20s bump. A static import moves the cost into the collection
// phase where it belongs. `vi.resetModules()` was ceremony — nothing
// here depends on fresh module state (the stream's state is per-call,
// held in `openMcpNotificationStream`'s closure).
