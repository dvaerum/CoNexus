# Regression guard: the Nix expressions must not re-declare a Python
# application, and the router must not be re-vendored under `nix/`.
#
# Background
# ----------
#
# `nix/package.nix` and `nix/packages.nix` both built a near-identical
# `agentMcpPy` (`buildPythonApplication`) derivation with *separately
# maintained* dependency lists, and they drifted:
#
# - `packages.nix` carried `sse-starlette`, `aiohttp`, `requests`
#   and the version-gated `mcp` floor override.
# - `package.nix` carried none of them — it worked only because `mcp`
#   happened to pull `sse-starlette` transitively.
#
# Every sweep had to be applied twice (the `python312` -> `python3`
# move in PR #603 touched both; the `mcp` pin only reached one), which
# is the failure mode documented in `docs/learnings/duplication-drift.md`:
# a fact with no single home.
#
# `nix/package.nix` turned out to be unreachable except for two flake
# outputs that were themselves redundant (see the PR that added this
# file), so the fix was deletion, not extraction.
#
# Retirement note
# ----------------
#
# The Python implementation this guard was originally about — the whole
# `conexus/app`/`conexus/router`/`conexus/cli.py` tree —
# was deleted wholesale once the Rust `rust/` workspace reached
# functional completeness (packaged separately via `nix/conexus.nix`).
# `nix/packages.nix` no longer calls `buildPythonApplication` at all
# — the "exactly one call site" invariant tightened to "zero call sites,
# anywhere": a second Python application derivation would be a full
# re-introduction of the retired implementation, not a drift of an
# existing one.
