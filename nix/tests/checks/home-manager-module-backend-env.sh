# Regression guard: the home-manager module's per-project backend
# service declares the env vars its OWN implementation actually needs —
# and, now that the implementation changed, does NOT carry over an env
# var whose need was specific to the retired one.
#
# Background (Python-backend era)
# --------------------------------
#
# PR #223 fixed `agent-mcp-router.service` by setting
# `AGENT_MCP_ROUTER_DB=${config.xdg.dataHome}/agent-mcp/router.db`. The
# same drift then bit the per-project backend template
# (`agent-mcp@<project>.service`), which never set the env var at all.
#
# Real reproduction on the deployed system (2026-06-24):
#
#     $ curl -b cookies '.../api/<project>/all-data' \
#         -H 'Accept: application/vnd.agent-mcp.v1+json'
#     -> 401 {"detail":{"error":"login_required", ...}}
#
#     $ journalctl --user -u 'agent-mcp@<project>.service'
#     agent_mcp.app.deps - WARNING - operator-session resolution failed
#       for session '...'; treating as anonymous
#
# Root cause: the Python backend's `_resolve_session_user` lazily
# imported `..router.identity` and opened the SAME sqlite router.db the
# router process used, to resolve a forwarded operator-session cookie
# directly against it. Without `AGENT_MCP_ROUTER_DB` set, that open hit
# the `/var/lib/agent-mcp/router.db` default, which user-mode units
# cannot read.
#
# Retirement note — this requirement does not carry over to conexus@
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The Python backend (`agent-mcp@<name>.service`) was retired together
# with the rest of the Python implementation; `conexus@<name>.service`
# (Rust) is the sole per-project backend now, and it does NOT open
# router.db at all — see `home-manager-module.nix`'s own comment on the
# `conexus@` unit: "conexus-backend doesn't touch the router.db at all
# ... matching Python's own documented behavior for this seam" (Wave 3
# already deleted the parallel `--system-token-out` plumbing; the
# forwarding-HMAC signature the router signs into its proxied requests is
# the ONLY remaining router->backend auth channel). So the invariant this
# check now pins is the opposite of its original one: `conexus@` must NOT
# carry an `CONEXUS_ROUTER_DB` entry that would be dead weight
# suggesting a code path that doesn't exist in this implementation.
