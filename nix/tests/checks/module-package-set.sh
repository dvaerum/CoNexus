# Regression guard: the home-manager module builds *everything it still
# builds itself* from one package set, and nothing is spliced onto the
# result post-hoc.
#
# Background
# ----------
#
# `services.agent-mcp.package` let an operator swap the agent-mcp Python
# derivation. It did nothing. The module applied it by splicing the
# attribute onto the result of `nix/packages.nix`:
#
#     resolvedPkgs =
#       if cfg.package == null then pkgs'
#       else pkgs' // { agentMcpPy = cfg.package; };
#
# By the time `packages.nix` returned, it had already built
# `agentMcpRouterWrapper`, `agentMcpBackendWrapper`,
# `agentMcpLauncher` and the daemon-agent wrapper around its *own*
# `agentMcpPy` and `python` — each wrapper baked in
# `${python}/bin/python` and a PYTHONPATH computed from the internal
# tree. Replacing the attribute afterwards changed something nothing
# downstream read, so every systemd unit kept exec'ing the
# internally-built tree. The knob lied, silently, for as long as it
# existed.
#
# The option is gone (`mkRemovedOptionModule`) and
# `services.agent-mcp.pkgs` — a whole package SET — took its place.
#
# Retirement note (this check, current shape)
# ------------------------------------------------
#
# The Python implementation this bug was originally about — `agentMcpPy`,
# its interpreter, and the PYTHONPATH-coupled wrappers around it — was
# deleted wholesale together with the rest of the Python source tree; the
# Rust `rust/` workspace (packaged via `nix/conexus.nix`, wired in as
# `conexusLauncherPackage`/`conexusRouterPackage`/
# `conexusDaemonAgentPackage`) replaced it. Those three options are
# externally-supplied packages (`nullOr package`) this module never
# builds itself — they do NOT move with `services.conexus.pkgs` from
# THIS module's own point of view (the flake's own `homeModules.default`
# wrapper is what threads `cfg.pkgs` into building them, one layer up —
# see `nix/tests/checks/single-source-of-truth.sh`-adjacent coverage for
# that wiring). What `cfg.pkgs` still governs *inside this module* is
# `nix/packages.nix`'s remaining two derivations: the dashboard
# (Next.js/npm) and the daemon-agent PreCompact hook (bash/curl/jq).
#
# So the guard now has three tiers:
#
# * source-structural checks, which run everywhere, pin the shape: one
#   import of `packages.nix`, fed from `cfg.pkgs`, with nothing
#   spliced onto the result, and no re-introduced Python coupling;
# * a real `nix eval` (skipped where nix is unavailable) proves
#   `cfg.pkgs` actually reaches the dashboard build's output path, not
#   just an unused attribute;
# * the same eval proves the conexus units are correctly INDEPENDENT of
#   `cfg.pkgs` in this module's own scope — the new, deliberate shape,
#   not a regression of the old bug.
