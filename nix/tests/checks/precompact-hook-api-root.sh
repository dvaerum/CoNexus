# Precompact-hook URL-derivation contract.
#
# The daemon-agent precompact hook
# (`nix/conexus-daemon-agent-precompact-hook.sh.in`) posts a tiny
# resume-pointer back to the project_context REST endpoint. To do that
# it needs the REST API root, which it derives from `CONEXUS_MCP_URL`.
#
# Pre-PR-D (URL redesign), MCP URLs were:
#     https://host/conexus/<name>/mcp
# so `${mcp_url%/mcp}/api` stripped the trailing `/mcp` and gave
#     https://host/conexus/<name>/api
# which is NOT the REST root anyway -- but for the project_context POST
# that path coincidentally worked because the old REST surface lived
# under `/conexus/<name>/...`.
#
# Post-PR-D the URL is:
#     https://host/conexus/mcp/<name>
# `${mcp_url%/mcp}` is now a NO-OP (the suffix doesn't match), so the
# old line produced `https://host/conexus/mcp/<name>/api` -- which
# doesn't exist and 404s.
#
# The correct derivation: strip the trailing `/mcp/<name>` and append
# `/api/projects/<name>`. The hook then POSTs to
# `/api/projects/<name>/project-context` which is the canonical
# REST-shape resource.
#
# This test extracts the derivation block from the .sh.in template
# (rather than duplicating the bash expression here) so a future tweak
# to the template is automatically reflected in the test, and runs it
# in isolation against representative URL shapes so the contract is
# locked.
