# pkgs.nixosTest: end-to-end smoke for single-tenant router mode.
#
# Mirror of multi-tenant.nix with the opposite toggle wired in: the
# router boots with --single-tenant only-project --single-workspace
# /home/testuser/projects/only-project. The projects.local.json seed
# the home-manager module would normally ExecStartPre is inlined as
# its own systemd ExecStartPre on the router unit.
#
# Three assertions specific to single-tenant mode:
#
#   1. POST/DELETE/PATCH on /api/router/projects/... all return 410
#      with the documented JSON body shape (ADR 0014).
#   2. /app/<wrong-name>/<section> → 302 Location:
#      /app/only-project/<section>  (W1 redirect; decision #9).
#   3. /app/only-project/ → 200 (sanity: the configured project's
#      URL is unaffected).

    # R8-F2 discovery: single-tenant mode only bypasses the ROUTER's
    # own operator-session gate (auth_middleware.py, via
    # single_tenant.bypasses_operator_gate()) — the /api/<name>/...
    # REST proxy forwards the request three hops to the BACKEND's own
    # FastAPI process, whose `require_operator_session` dependency
    # (conexus/app/deps.py) has no single-tenant awareness at all and
    # 401s a bare unauthenticated request in EITHER mode. Log in first,
    # same as every other test in this suite that reaches an
    # operator-gated route — the bootstrap credentials are already
    # wired into this unit's environment above, just never used by any
    # assertion before this one.

    # equivalent: `conexus-backend` links `sqlite-vec` statically via
    # the `conexus-vec` crate (see rust/conexus-vec/src/lib.rs) rather
    # than dlopen'ing a loadable-extension file at runtime, so it
    # doesn't log an analogous "confirmed loadable" line, and the two
    # hardening directives (MemoryDenyWriteExecute, SystemCallFilter)
    # this check existed to protect were deliberately omitted for
    # CPython's own ctypes-extension-loading needs specifically -- it
    # is a genuinely open question whether that omission rationale
    # still applies to the Rust binary the same way. The
    # `systemctl show` hardening-properties loop above and the earlier
    # blocking `/api/.../status` curl already prove the backend is up
    # and serving under the 5 hardening directives; a Rust-specific
    # replacement for the VSS-loadability half of this guard is
    # unresolved and flagged for follow-up rather than faked here.
