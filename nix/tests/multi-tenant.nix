# pkgs.nixosTest: end-to-end smoke for multi-tenant router mode.
#
# Runs as a systemd-nspawn container (`containers.machine`), not a QEMU
# VM (`nodes.machine`) — nixpkgs' native nspawn test-driver support
# (nixos/lib/testing/nodes.nix). Picked as the pilot for this backend
# swap because it has no systemd-hardening-directive assertions and no
# multi-node topology (see docs/learnings/nspawn-test-migration.md for
# why, and why single-tenant.nix stays on QEMU). Boots a single
# container with the router unit + a per-project backend template,
# then drives the public HTTP surface:
#
#   1. POST /api/router/projects twice (two projects, JSON body).
#   2. GET  /api/router/projects lists both names.
#   3. Deep-link into one project's dashboard returns 200 (the
#      handler serves index.html for any /app/<name>/ path).
#   4. The retired SSE handshake URL returns 404 (Phase 6 deleted
#      the transitional 410-Gone handlers; the URL now falls through
#      to aiohttp's default 404, which is the new contract).
#
# The backend isn't actually exercised here — booting the full
# embedding pipeline against ollama would balloon the test runtime.
# This is the cheap CI-friendly half; there is no expensive-half
# counterpart anymore. A deploy-repo E2E suite used to cover the real
# Ollama/RAG path (home-manager-config, formerly nixos-developer-
# system) but was deleted 2026-09-06 as clearly outdated — its
# admin-credential bootstrap tested a mechanism this codebase retired
# independent of any Rust-migration cutover (PR #206, "delete admin
# pseudo-agent + disentangle system bearer from agents table"). No
# real-embedding-pipeline coverage exists anywhere right now; a fresh
# one would need a real admin-tier bearer (via register_agent) rather
# than the old journal-scraped admin token, not a revival of the
# deleted suite.
#
# ADR 0014: the admin surface lives at ``/api/router/...`` (was the
# legacy ``__*`` namespace).
#
# Mirror counterpart: ./single-tenant.nix (same harness, opposite
# toggle assertions).
