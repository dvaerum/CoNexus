# Path B interactive sandbox VM — boots the multi-tenant stack like
# nix/vm.nix but with three differences tailored for dashboard E2E
# work and live in-VM diagnostics:
#
#   1. forwardPorts maps host:18080 → guest:1337 (the router port)
#      by default. 18080 is also the literal sentinel that
#      nix/run-vm-dev.sh rewrites at launch time when
#      AGENT_MCP_VM_DEV_HOST_PORT is set, so a developer whose host
#      already binds :18080 (e.g. SeaweedFS) can pick another port
#      without rebuilding the VM derivation. The standard vm.nix
#      uses host:5454 — this VM exists in parallel so a dev can
#      have both running without port collisions, and so the
#      Firefox-MCP smoke script in the prancy-napping-pie plan can
#      target the documented localhost:18080 URL verbatim.
#
#   2. AGENT_MCP_BOOTSTRAP_USERNAME / _PASSWORD are seeded on the
#      router systemd unit so the first-boot identity store comes up
#      with a known operator already created (username/password both
#      `dev`). That short-circuits the Phase-1 empty-users redirect
#      to /setup — a developer opening the dashboard lands on /login
#      and can sign in immediately, then create projects via the UI.
#      No HTTP-call-at-boot bootstrap: ADR 0014 removed the legacy
#      `/__create` form-encoded endpoint, and its REST replacement
#      `POST /api/router/projects` requires a session cookie that a
#      systemd oneshot can't have. Operator seeding via env vars is
#      the only post-Phase-1+2 path that works at boot.
#
#   3. **DEV-MODE SSH IS WIDE OPEN.** OpenSSH is enabled with root
#      login, empty passwords, and password auth all permitted, plus
#      a host:18222 → guest:22 forward (sentinel rewritten at launch
#      via AGENT_MCP_VM_DEV_SSH_PORT, same pattern as the dashboard
#      port). This exists so we can read `systemctl status`,
#      `journalctl -u …`, /run/agent-mcp/, /var/lib/agent-mcp/, and
#      /var/log/journal/ inside the VM when a per-project backend
#      misbehaves (cf. verify-all P006: backend UDS spawn timeout).
#      This MUST NOT be copied into nix/vm.nix (the production VM).
#      A boot-time systemd banner and a motd shout this restriction
#      so the next maintainer cargo-culting from this file notices.
#
#   4. **EXTERNAL LLM MODE.** `llm = "external"` is passed to vm.nix
#      below, so this VM runs NO in-guest ollama and preloads no
#      model weights; the backend is pointed at endpoints already
#      running on the developer's HOST via qemu user-mode's
#      10.0.2.2 host alias (chat on :11435, embeddings on :11434 by
#      default). That drops guest RAM from 4096 MB to 2048 MB —
#      which is the difference between "can boot the sandbox" and
#      "cannot" on a busy workstation, and this VM exists precisely
#      for interactive dashboard E2E where the RAG models are never
#      exercised. nix/vm.nix keeps `internal` as its default so the
#      production/CI VMs stay self-contained; see that file's header
#      for the full option contract, the env-var mapping, and the
#      boot-time endpoint probe that hard-fails rather than letting
#      a backend run with dead embeddings.
#
# Everything else (systemd shape, agent-mcp services) is inherited
# from the regular multi-tenant module. We import vm.nix directly and
# patch the divergent attrs via lib.mkForce.

  # NOTE: A legacy `agent-mcp-vm-dev-seed.service` used to live here.
  # It waited for `/var/lib/agent-mcp/projects/agent-select-dev/admin_token`
  # to appear and then POSTed `/api/create-agent` with that token as a
  # bearer to pre-seed two worker agents. Both halves of that contract
  # were retired in Phases 1+2: (a) the "all-powerful admin_token" file
  # no longer exists — agent-side auth is per-agent worker/manager
  # tokens minted at create-agent time, and (b) the project itself
  # never got created at boot because the upstream bootstrap unit's
  # `/__create` call was already broken (ADR 0014). The seed unit
  # timed out at 30s on every boot with `admin token not found`.
  # Retired entirely — the operator (seeded via the env-var bootstrap
  # above) creates projects + agents through the dashboard UI, which
  # is the same path a real user takes. verify-all drives that same
  # UI via Firefox-MCP, so we don't need a back-door seed.
