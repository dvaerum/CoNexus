#
# History: this module used to also support `mode = "single"` (one
# always-on Python backend on a bare TCP port, no router) and
# `mode = "multi"` selecting between that and the router shape below.
# Both modes ran the Python implementation (`agent-mcp@<name>.service`
# / `agent-mcp-router.service`), retired together with the Python
# source tree. The router shape survives as the module's only shape,
# rebuilt on the CoNexus Rust binaries (`conexus@<name>.service` /
# `conexus-router.service`) — `conexusLauncherPackage`/
# `conexusRouterPackage` below. The bare-TCP-port single-backend shape
# has NO Rust equivalent: `conexus-backend` only serves over `--uds`
# (see rust/conexus-backend/src/main.rs's own module doc — host:port
# serving was explicitly never ported, since no `conexus@<name>.service`
# caller needs it). Reviving it would mean adding TCP-serving support
# to conexus-backend, which is out of scope for this retirement; until
# that happens, single-backend deploys have no supported path through
# this module.
