# Home-manager module exposing conexus as user-scope systemd units.
#
# This module ships in the dvaerum/CoNexus fork (Phase 2 of the
# router-upstream plan, prancy-napping-pie). It mirrors the
# multi-tenant deployment that previously lived in
# nixos-developer-system/users/dennis/conexus/default.nix verbatim,
# so the byte-shape of the resulting systemd unit files is identical
# up to store-path hashes.
#
# Shape:
#
#   - One declared list `daemonAgents` → N systemd template instances
#     (conexus-daemon-agent@<project>--<agent_id>.service), each
#     running an event-driven wait_for_events loop against the router.
#   - A thin always-on router (conexus-router.service, the CoNexus Rust
#     router — see `conexusRouterPackage` below) on 127.0.0.1:<port>
#     (default 1337) does URL-path routing + activity tracking, calls
#     systemctl --user start/stop for lazy spawn + idle shutdown, and
#     serves the Next.js static dashboard at /conexus/app/<name>/.
#   - Per-project backends (conexus@<name>.service template — see
#     `conexusLauncherPackage` below) are lazy-started by the router on
#     first MCP request and idle-stopped after
#     services.conexus.router.idleSec seconds.
#
# The Python implementation (agent-mcp@<name>.service /
# agent-mcp-router.service, and the `router.impl` A/B flip between
# them and their Rust counterparts) was retired once the Python source
# tree was deleted wholesale and the Rust `rust/` workspace reached
# functional completeness — see git history around the packages.nix
# and this file's own `router.impl` removal for the cutover.
#
# Project membership is *not* declared in nix. Every project is
# registered at runtime via POST /conexus/api/router/projects
# (dashboard form or `curl`, JSON body), recorded in
# ~/.config/conexus/projects.local.json. The module materialises the
# router + systemd template + the daemon-agent wiring; project list
# lives outside source control.
#
# `services.conexus.multiTenant` (default true) picks the deployment
# shape. When set to false, the operator additionally declares
# `services.conexus.singleProject = { name, workspace }`; the
# module seeds a one-entry projects.local.json via ExecStartPre on
# the router unit and passes --single-tenant / --single-workspace
# to the router so its write endpoints 410 and W1 redirects fire
# (decision #1 + #9; ADR-0008).

  # seed the launcher couldn't resolve <name> → workspace path and the
  # backend would never start.
  #
  # The seed is idempotent and conservative: if a file already exists
  # AND already contains the declared project under the declared
  # name, we leave it alone (operators may have hand-extended the
  # file, or it may be a successful seed from a previous boot). When

      A single derivation also cannot carry the interpreter and

        longer exists: the Python router doesn't exist to race against
        (it and `router.impl` were deleted together), so there is
        exactly one router implementation for this option to enable,

        cutover decision, it's just how the module gets its one

        Package set the dashboard (Next.js static export) and the
        daemon-agent PreCompact hook are built from in packages.nix —
        and, via the flake's own `homeModules.default` wrapper, ALSO
        the package set + toolchain (`crane.mkLib`) the CoNexus Rust
        binaries (`conexusLauncherPackage`/`conexusRouterPackage`/
        `conexusDaemonAgentPackage`) are built from, since that
        wrapper threads this same option straight into its own
        `nix/conexus.nix` import. Defaults to the `pkgs` home-manager
        itself is configured with, which is what you want unless you
        have a specific reason otherwise.

        **Why you would set it — the stable-channel security lag.**
        NixOS *stable* branches do not take routine backports the way
        nixos-unstable does, so a host tracking e.g. nixos-26.05 can
        lag behind on a dependency with a known advisory (previously:
        the Python router's aiohttp; today the equivalent risk surface
        is whatever crates.io advisories land against the `rust/`
        workspace's dependency graph, or the dashboard's npm tree).
        Pointing this option at a fresher package set rebuilds
        conexus's own derivations — and, through the flake wrapper,
        the Rust toolchain they compile against — against it; the rest
        of the home-manager profile stays on the stable channel:

        ```nix
        services.conexus.pkgs = import conexus.inputs.nixpkgs {
          inherit (pkgs.stdenv.hostPlatform) system;
        };
        ```

        Note that conexus's own flake pin does NOT do this for you.
        The module builds from the *consumer's* package set by
        construction, so dropping `inputs.conexus.inputs.nixpkgs.follows`
        in your flake changes only what `nix build` inside conexus's
        own flake produces — not your deployed closure. This option is
        the switch that does.

        It must be a whole package set, not a single derivation — a
        derivation from one channel paired with a toolchain/stdenv from
        another does not merely mix closures, it can fail to build or
        import. (That mismatch is also why `services.conexus.package`
        was removed, back when this option's own derivation was the
        Python application specifically.)
