# Production package set for the agent-mcp home-manager module.
#
# The Python implementation (`agent_mcp/app`, `agent_mcp/router`,
# `agent_mcp/cli.py`, etc.) was deleted wholesale once the Rust
# `rust/` workspace (conexus-backend / conexus-router / conexus-
# daemon-agent, packaged separately in `nix/conexus.nix`) reached
# functional completeness and became what actually runs in
# production. This file used to also build `agentMcpPy` and the
# Python-coupled wrappers around it (`agentMcpBackendWrapper`,
# `agentMcpRouterWrapper`, `agentMcpLauncher`, the daemon-agent
# runner/wrapper pair) plus two Python-router-only assets
# (`readmeHtml`, `installerTemplate`) -- all retired together with
# the Python source tree itself. See `nix/conexus.nix` for their
# Rust replacements and `nix/home-manager-module.nix` for how the
# systemd units now consume them unconditionally (no more
# `router.impl` A/B flip).
#
# What's left here:
#
#   agentMcpDashboard                 — the Next.js static export,
#                                        served by the router. Always
#                                        was independent of the Python
#                                        tree (buildNpmPackage over
#                                        agent_mcp/dashboard/, which
#                                        this repo's Python deletion
#                                        never touched).
#   agentMcpDaemonAgentPrecompactHook — Claude Code PreCompact hook
#                                       for daemon agents. A standalone
#                                       bash script substituted via
#                                       `runCommand`; never depended on
#                                       the Python interpreter or tree.

  # read pyproject.toml's `version = "X.Y.Z"` (the single source of
  # truth while the Python implementation existed); package.json is
  # the direct replacement now that Python packaging is gone entirely

  # derives" shape, just relocated to the one manifest this package

  # `out/` directory at /agent-mcp/app/.

  # Phase 4 (prancy-napping-pie): we deliberately do NOT set
  # `ASSET_PREFIX` here. The dashboard's `next.config.ts` now defaults
  # the assetPrefix to a literal sentinel string
  # (`__AGENT_MCP_ASSET_PREFIX__`); the router substitutes the
  # configured runtime prefix on serve. One build artifact serves
  # every deployment URL — no rebuild needed when the operator points
  # the router at a different prefix.
