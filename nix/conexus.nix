# Rust-Nix packaging for the CoNexus migration (Phase D1 step 4,
# prancy-napping-pie). Parallel to nix/packages.nix's Python
# derivations, but for the rust/ Cargo workspace — kept in its own
# file rather than folded into packages.nix so the crane wiring (a
# genuinely new build toolchain for this repo) stays easy to find and
# doesn't tangle with the Python derivation list.
#
# Top-level derivations:
#
#   conexusBackend   — the compiled `conexus-backend` binary
#                       (rust/conexus-backend), built via
#                       craneLib.buildPackage against the whole
#                       workspace (rusqlite's bundled sqlite3 needs a
#                       C compiler on PATH, which crane's default
#                       stdenv already provides).
#
#   conexusRouter    — the compiled `conexus-router` binary (Phase F,
#                       "safe to start now" packaging slice per the
#                       Phase F research pass, prancy-napping-pie).
#                       Mirrors conexusBackend's own buildPackage
#                       shape exactly. NOT yet wired into any
#                       home-manager option that would make it live in
#                       production — see conexusRouterWrapper below.
#
# Plus the systemd-template launcher the `conexus@<name>.service` unit
# (Phase D1 step 5) will invoke:
#
#   conexusLauncher  — bash launcher, structurally identical to
#                       nix/packages.nix's `agentMcpLauncher` (same
#                       project-registry lookup, same sock-path
#                       formula) so a `backend_impl` flip between
#                       `agent-mcp@<name>` and `conexus@<name>` is a
#                       same-path process swap (Phase D1 decision #1)
#                       — exec's `conexus-backend` instead of the
#                       Python wrapper.
#
# And a thin wrapper for the router binary, mirroring
# nix/packages.nix's `agentMcpRouterWrapper` shape (a one-liner exec,
# not a per-instance resolver like conexusLauncher above — the router
# is a singleton reading its own CLI flags/env vars directly, with no
# `<name>` positional argument to resolve):
#
#   conexusRouterWrapper — thin writeShellScriptBin invoking
#                       `conexus-router "$@"`. Not yet consumed by any
#                       systemd unit — deploying it to replace
#                       `agent-mcp-router.service` is Phase F's
#                       genuine operator-authority cutover decision,
#                       tracked separately from this packaging work.
#
#   conexusDaemonAgent      — the compiled `conexus-daemon-agent`
#                       binary (rust/conexus-daemon-agent): the
#                       reference daemon-agent event loop, ported for
#                       implementation-language consistency (operator
#                       decision, 2026-09-06) — it's a pure MCP
#                       wire-protocol client with no functional
#                       dependency on which backend/router it talks
#                       to. Replaces the Python pair
#                       (agentMcpDaemonAgentRunner +
#                       agentMcpDaemonAgentWrapper in packages.nix)
#                       as ONE binary — no separate bash wrapper is
#                       needed since the Rust binary resolves its own
#                       token/URL/cursor paths directly.
#   conexusDaemonAgentWrapper — thin writeShellScriptBin invoking
#                       `conexus-daemon-agent "$@"`, same rationale as
#                       conexusRouterWrapper above.
