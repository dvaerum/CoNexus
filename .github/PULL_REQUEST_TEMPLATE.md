## What changed

<!-- One or two sentences. The diff already shows the code. -->

## Why

<!--
The problem this fixes, the capability this adds, or the constraint
this relieves. If there's an issue (in this repo or upstream's),
link it.
-->

## Red → green

<!--
Required for any PR with behavioral change. Build-only PRs (Nix
build hygiene, CI config, font/asset changes) can write "n/a — build
only" here.

- Failing test commit: <sha or test name>
- Passing test commit: <sha or test name>

Backend/router tests live alongside the code (`#[cfg(test)] mod
tests` in the same `.rs` file); dashboard tests live in
`conexus/dashboard/tests/*.test.ts`; Nix/home-manager tests live in
`nix/tests/checks/*.sh`. Name the specific test(s) so a reviewer can
run them locally.

  deployment repo: <link to the relevant section>
