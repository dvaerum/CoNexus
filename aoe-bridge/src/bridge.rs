//! The orchestrator: reconcile covered sessions, hold one SSE delivery stream
//! per session, report transport-status up, and inject rendered frames down.
//!
//! Each reconcile pass (every `status_interval_secs`, or immediately on a
//! `plugin.settings.changed` nudge):
//! 1. load settings via `config.get`;
//! 2. fetch per-session liveness via AoE's web REST `GET /api/sessions`
//!    (worker state, not just status — so a stopped session reads `dormant`);
//! 3. resolve the per-session routes;
//! 4. for each live route: POST its transport-status, assert its per-session
//!    MCP, switch it to ACP if asked, and ensure exactly one SSE task is running
//!    (respawning it if its endpoint/token/AoE creds changed);
//! 5. for a configured-but-not-live session: POST `dead` and drop its task;
//! 6. drop tasks whose session left the mapping;
//! 7. publish the observable state to the plugin's AoE settings page.
//!
//! A per-session SSE task reconnects with backoff on drop — a transient stream
//! drop is not a session end (ADR-0021); the policy re-fires on reconnect.
//!
//! ## Routing: decided per inject, not per pass
//!
//! AoE runs a session either as a terminal (`/send`) or a structured/ACP view
//! (`/acp/prompt`), and injecting on the wrong one is REFUSED — the nudge is
//! dropped, not queued. A route resolved once per pass but used for the whole
//! interval is therefore a standing hazard: the session's view can change under
//! it at any moment (this bridge's own `ensure_acp`, an operator flipping the
//! view, a respawn coming back the other way, a structured worker dying).
//!
//! So the mode is NOT a property of the running stream. Three layers, in order:
//!
//! 1. **Resolution** ([`effective_mode`]) runs per frame, off AoE's
//!    authoritative `view` field read through a short-TTL cache
//!    ([`RuntimeModes`]) — so there is no window in which a stale mode can be
//!    used, only a ≤[`LIVENESS_TTL`] window in which a stale *snapshot* can be.
//! 2. **Self-healing** ([`on_refusal`]) treats AoE's own refusal as the last
//!    word: the two responses that name a mode mismatch trigger exactly one
//!    retry on the other transport, and the correction is remembered for the
//!    session's later frames. This holds even if layer 1 is wrong for a reason
//!    nobody anticipated.
//! 3. **An explicit `mode` in the row always wins over both.** Operator intent
//!    is not drift; a pin AoE refuses is reported loudly, never overridden.
//!
//! Consequently `mode` is deliberately absent from the task fingerprint
//! ([`Route::fingerprint`]): a session flipping views must correct its routing
//! WITHOUT tearing down and reopening its delivery stream.
//!
//! ## Observability
//!
//! Every step above records into a shared [`Snapshot`] ([`crate::status`]) that
//! [`run_publisher`] pushes to the host as a `settings-page` UI entry, and logs
//! through [`crate::observe`] at a level chosen for volume: per-frame and
//! per-inject traffic is `debug`, state *transitions* (stream up/down, coverage
//! gained/lost) are `info`, degraded-but-retrying is `warn`, and a refused
//! injection is `error`. An inject failure also captures the AoE error BODY,
//! not just the status code — that body is what names the cause (`400
//! acp_mode_unsupported`), and dropping it is what made the original outage
//! invisible.
