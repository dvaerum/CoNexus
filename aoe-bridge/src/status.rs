//! Live bridge state, and the AoE home-pane it renders into.
//!
//! ## Why a `home-pane`
//!
//! A runtime worker has exactly two channels to the operator, and the host owns
//! both (verified against the AoE host source):
//!
//! - **`ui.state.set`** into a slot the manifest declares (`src/plugin/host_api.rs`,
//!   `ui_state_set` → `require_declared_slot`). Gated on the `runtime.worker`
//!   capability, which the bridge already holds. Typed, host-validated, and it
//!   *persists* until the worker exits — the only inspectable surface a plugin has.
//! - **`ui.notify`** — a transient toast, gated on `notifications`. It lives in a
//!   200-entry in-memory ring that dies with the daemon, so it is an alert, not a
//!   record.
//!
//! Everything else is a dead end, and each was considered and rejected:
//!
//! - **The `status` command returning live state.** `POST /api/plugins/commands/
//!   {fqid}/invoke` answers `202 {"ok": true}` and forwards the command to the
//!   worker as a JSON-RPC *notification* with no `id`
//!   (`src/server/api/plugins.rs` → `PluginHost::notify_worker`). The worker is
//!   protocol-forbidden from replying, so a command can never return anything.
//!   Instead the command triggers an immediate repaint of this page plus a
//!   summary toast — the idiomatic host pattern (the same one pane actions use).
//! - **Worker stderr.** Lands in `<app_dir>/plugin-workers/<uuid>.log`, a file
//!   with an unguessable per-spawn name that nothing reads. See [`crate::observe`].
//! - **`events.publish`.** A plugin-to-plugin bus persisted to `plugin_events.db`
//!   with no HTTP endpoint and no UI reader — invisible to an operator.
//! - **The `[[status]]` manifest contribution.** Static metadata with zero
//!   consumers in the host.
//! - **Folding inject health into conexus's `/delivery/status`.** That channel
//!   reports the *session's* transport-status over a closed four-value vocabulary
//!   (`working|idle|dormant|dead`, `delivery_transport.VALID_STATUSES`), and
//!   conexus's delivery policy stops nudging a `dead` worker. Reporting a
//!   failing inject as `dead` would silence the very deliveries the operator is
//!   trying to repair, and any new value needs a cross-repo protocol change. The
//!   channel stays what it is; inject health is a *bridge* concern and belongs
//!   on the bridge's own page.
//!
//! `home-pane` is global (not per-session), so one entry covers every
//! session the bridge holds — which is exactly the cross-session question an
//! operator asks ("is anything broken?"). A per-session `pane` would need N
//! entries and would only be visible while sitting in that one session's view.
//!
//! ## What is never rendered here
//!
//! Tokens and message bodies. The page carries session ids, the conexus
//! project name, counters, timestamps, HTTP status codes, and the delivery
//! frame's `reason` (a fixed enum: `unread_messages` / `unfinished_tasks` /
//! `unassigned_tasks`). It carries **no** message subjects, no senders, no task
//! titles, and no bearer — see [`SessionObs::note_frame`], which takes counts
//! and a reason rather than the frame itself, so there is no path for body
//! content to reach the page in the first place.
