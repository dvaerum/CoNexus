/**
 * The `!important` width override that killed every responsive width
 * utility (fix/agents-status-badge-overflow).
 *
 * Source-text guards in the house style (pure Node — see
 * tests/ux-polish.test.ts for the rationale).
 *
 * `app/globals.css` carried, inside `@layer components`:
 *
 *     .w-full { width: 100% !important; }
 *
 * commented "Ensure full width layouts don't have unwanted margins".
 * It is redundant with Tailwind's own `.w-full` (which lives in the
 * later `@layer utilities` and therefore already wins) — except for the
 * `!important`, which made it beat EVERY responsive override. Because
 * an `!important` declaration inside a cascade layer outranks both
 * unlayered rules and later layers, `w-full sm:w-40` resolved to 100%
 * at all breakpoints. Verified in Firefox on the live dashboard: the
 * Messages filter bar's six controls each computed to 924.8px and
 * stacked one per row, pushing the table to y=894 on a 800px-tall
 * viewport. Deleting exactly this one rule from the live stylesheet
 * (CSSOM `deleteRule`) put all six controls on one row and moved the
 * table to y=546, with the phone layout (390px) unchanged.
 *
 * The idiom it broke is used by six dashboards, so the guard is
 * written against the whole stylesheet, not just `.w-full`.
