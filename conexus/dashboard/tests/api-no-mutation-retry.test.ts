/**
 * The dashboard API client MUST NOT retry mutating HTTP methods.
 *
 * The shared `request<T>()` helper in
 * `conexus/dashboard/lib/api/client.ts` (the request core the
 * W6-followup F1 split extracted from the old `lib/api.ts` God-module)
 * implements a transparent retry-on-5xx loop intended to absorb the
 * ~10-15s cold-start latency of a lazily-spawned backend (router proxy
 * returns 502/503/504 while the UDS comes up). The retry was added in
 * the Candidate-C refactor (architecture review 2026-06-01) as a
 * universal wrapper — it does not branch on HTTP method.
 *
 * The bug: `request()` is reused for every API call, including
 * `createAgent` (POST /api/agents), `createTask` (POST /api/tasks),
 * `terminateAgent` (POST /api/terminate-agent), `editAgent`
 * (POST /api/agents/<id>/edit), `updateTask` (POST), and `purgeAgent`
 * (DELETE with body). When the backend processes a mutation, commits
 * the side-effect, and then crashes/disconnects returning 502 on the
 * response phase, the retry re-issues the same mutation. Two real
 * outcomes:
 *
 *   - createAgent → "agent_id already exists" 4xx (caught) on retry,
 *     but the first creation succeeded — the user sees an error and
 *     assumes nothing happened.
 *   - createTask → creates two tasks with identical title/description
 *     silently (task_id is server-generated so there's no uniqueness
 *     collision to catch the retry).
 *   - sendMessage / mark-as-read etc. — duplicate fan-out events.
 *
 * The fix: retries are safe ONLY for idempotent reads (GET / HEAD).
 * Mutations must surface the 5xx to the caller's catch handler so the
 * operator can see what happened and decide whether to retry manually.
 *
 * This test pins the contract by source-grep on the request core (house
 * source-grep convention, same pattern as the no-auto-cleanup and
 * no-legacy-redirects guards).
