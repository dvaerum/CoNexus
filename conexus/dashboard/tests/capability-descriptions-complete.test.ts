/**
 * Wave 9 PR 5 — capability descriptions registry validation.
 *
 * The dashboard surfaces capabilities (the grouped checklist under
 * each group on the groups dashboard) via a description registry at
 * ``conexus/dashboard/lib/capability-descriptions.ts``. The
 * canonical list of capability strings lives in
 * ``rust/conexus-core/src/capability.rs`` — the ``Capability`` enum's
 * ``as_str()`` method (Phase F, prancy-napping-pie: this test used to
 * parse ``conexus/core/capabilities.py``'s ``KNOWN_CAPABILITIES``
 * frozenset, deleted along with the rest of the Python source tree —
 * ``Capability``/``Capability::ALL`` is its direct, already-existing
 * Rust replacement, "the Rust equivalent of KNOWN_CAPABILITIES" per
 * that enum's own doc comment).
 *
 * This test enforces two-way completeness:
 *
 *  1. **Every cap in the Rust ``Capability`` enum has a description.**
 *     Adding a new cap to the backend without a description means the
 *     dashboard shows an empty tooltip — fails CI.
 *
 *  2. **Every key in the description registry exists in the Rust
 *     enum.**  Stale entries (cap removed from the backend,
 *     description forgotten) clutter the dashboard list with phantom
 *     capabilities that the resolver never grants — fails CI.
 *
 * Implementation: parse the Rust source for ``as_str()``'s match arms
 * (one ``Capability::Variant => "dotted.string",`` per line) rather
 * than shelling out to `cargo`/a real Rust toolchain. Keeps the
 * dashboard test suite self-contained — no Rust dep, no subprocess,
 * no test fixtures — and the parse is robust to comment lines and
 * leading whitespace because we only accept matches inside
 * double-quoted strings on a ``=>`` line.
