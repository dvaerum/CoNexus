/**
 * Regression guards for the destructive-action confirmation tiers.
 *
 * The model (canonical write-up lives in
 * `conexus/dashboard/components/dashboard/modals/confirm-action-modal.tsx`
 * — do not restate it here, reference it):
 *
 *   * tier 0 — no dialog, success toast
 *   * tier 1 — `<ConfirmActionModal>`: simple confirm that NAMES the target
 *   * tier 2 — `<DeleteConfirmModal>`: type `DELETE`
 *   * tier 3 — `<DeleteConfirmModal requiredWord={name} matchCase>`: type
 *     the entity's own name/id, case-sensitively
 *
 * Two properties are worth pinning in text, because both are the kind
 * of thing a later "let's make this consistent" refactor silently
 * undoes:
 *
 * 1. **Polymorphism.** Users type the username, groups the group name,
 *    projects the project name, purge the agent id. Four different
 *    strings means the gesture cannot become a reflex. A uniform
 *    `DELETE` across those pages would be ONE muscle-memory sequence
 *    that opens every tier-3 gate in the product.
 * 2. **Tier 1 stays cheap.** Memories / Schedules / Terminate / leaf-task
 *    delete must NOT carry a type-to-confirm gate. Habituation is what
 *    makes the expensive gates worthless, so the cheap actions have to
 *    stay cheap for the expensive ones to keep working.
 *
 * Text-parse guards, per the source-grep convention in this repo
 * (behaviour is covered by the vitest suites next to each component).
