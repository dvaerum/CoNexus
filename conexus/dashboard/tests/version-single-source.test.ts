/**
 * Regression guards: `package.json` is the single source of truth for
 * the product version shown in the dashboard UI.
 *
 * Historically four copies drifted apart: the Python package's
 * `__init__.__version__` froze at "2.2.0", the dashboard sidebar
 * hardcoded "v3.4.0", the dashboard `package.json` sat at the Next.js
 * scaffold default, and git tags stalled a scheme behind
 * `pyproject.toml` (5.0.71).
 *
 * `pyproject.toml` was the single source of truth while the Python
 * implementation existed; once it was deleted wholesale (Phase F,
 * prancy-napping-pie), `package.json`'s own `version` field took over
 * that role -- `next.config.ts`'s `resolveVersion()` reads it directly,
 * and `nix/packages.nix`'s `version` let-binding reads the exact same
 * file for the sandboxed Nix build. These tests fail the moment any
 * consumer re-hardcodes a literal instead of deriving from it.
