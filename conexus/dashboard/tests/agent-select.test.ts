/**
 * Regression guards for the shared `<AgentSelect>` component
 * (feat/agent-select-dropdown).
 *
 * Background
 * ----------
 *
 * Dennis reported that creating a task and assigning it to an agent
 * required the admin to *type* the agent_id into a plain `<Input>`
 * (`tasks-dashboard.tsx:495-500` pre-PR). Typo-friendly, no validation
 * that the agent exists, no visibility of available agents.
 *
 * The Phase-1 audit also surfaced two adjacent issues:
 *
 * - `EditTaskDialog` (`tasks-dashboard.tsx:964-988` pre-PR) DID use a
 *   shadcn `<Select>` but sourced its agent list from
 *   `apiClient.getAgents()` — which returns every row, including
 *   `status='terminated'`. Terminated agents leaked into the dropdown.
 * - No shared `<AgentSelect>` existed; each call-site reimplemented the
 *   dropdown by hand.
 *
 * This PR introduces
 * `conexus/dashboard/components/dashboard/shared/agent-select.tsx` —
 * a single shared dropdown that filters terminated agents via the
 * existing `getActiveAgents()` store helper, pins `Admin` at the top,
 * and accepts a caller-provided `noneLabel` prop so task forms can
 * render `— Unassigned —` while filter dropdowns render `— Any —`.
 * Every agent-input site is migrated to it.
 *
 * These are text-parse regression guards in the house source-grep
 * style — the dashboard ships no jsdom/RTL for this kind of guard, so
 * behaviour is exercised by `npm run build` plus a Firefox-MCP smoke
 * pass against the `nix run .#vm-dev` interactive sandbox.
