/**
 * Regression guards for the groups-list migration onto TanStack Query.
 *
 * History
 * -------
 * The router-admin surface (users / groups / SSO / memberships /
 * capabilities) rode the hand-rolled `useRouterQuery` hook — a
 * `{data, loading, error, forbidden, refresh}` state machine, the
 * router-admin sibling of the retired `usePagedQuery`.
 *
 * W6-followup F4 moved the GROUPS LIST read (`GET
 * /conexus/api/router/groups`) off `useRouterQuery` and onto the
 * shared TanStack Query `queryClient` via `useGroupsQuery`
 * (`lib/queries/groups.ts`), mirroring the F2 (tasks) / F3 (messages)
 * migrations. Two things make groups deliberately different from the
 * per-project lists, and this guard pins both:
 *
 *   * ROUTER-level key. `groupsQueryKey()` is a bare `['groups']` with
 *     NO project segment (contrast `['tasks', project, …]` /
 *     `['messages', project, …]`) — there is one groups list per router.
 *
 *   * NO SSE poll / invalidation. The groups page renders at the
 *     cross-project overview, which has no operator-events SSE stream, so
 *     freshness after a group mutation rides an explicit
 *     `invalidateGroups()` from each mutation's success handler rather
 *     than the debounced SSE choke point the per-project lists use.
 *
 * W6-followup-2 G2 then migrated the LAST four `useRouterQuery`
 * consumers — SSO, users, project memberships and the per-group
 * capabilities section — onto their own TanStack Query modules
 * (`lib/queries/{sso,users,project-memberships,group-capabilities}.ts`),
 * each with a bare-or-parent-scoped key + `invalidateX()` in
 * `lib/query-client.ts`. With zero consumers left, the hand-rolled hook
 * (`hooks/use-router-query.ts`) and its vitest guard were DELETED —
 * exactly the fully-retired shape of `use-paged-query.ts`. So the guard
 * below now asserts the hook is GONE and every former consumer imports its
 * TanStack replacement instead.
 *
 * These are text-parse regression guards (same convention as the
 * retired `use-paged-query` hook guard); behaviour is verified by the
 * vitest suites (`groups-query-invalidation.test.ts` +
 * `router-admin-queries-invalidation.test.ts` + `groups-dashboard.test.tsx`)
 * plus `npm run build`.
