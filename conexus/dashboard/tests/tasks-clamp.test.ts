/**
 * PF-1 clamp regression guard (Wave 3 — Table a11y + perf).
 *
 * tasks-dashboard fetches ALL tasks via GET /tasks (no server-side
 * pagination) and used to hand the full `filteredTasks` to the table
 * unbounded — the one dashboard list that rendered without a ceiling.
 * This pins the client-side clamp: a PAGE_SIZE, a sliced page window
 * fed to the table, an offset that resets when the filters change, and
 * a pagination footer — the same shape messages-dashboard already uses.
 *
 * Grep-based for the same reason as tests/mobile-load.test.ts: the
 * property we owe is "the list is bounded", a property of the SOURCE
 * wiring, and the dashboard's dependency graph is too heavy to mount in
 * the node-only harness.
