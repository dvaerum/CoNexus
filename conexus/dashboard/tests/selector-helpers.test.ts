/**
 * Regression guards for PR-W1d (architecture deepening, Finding #7):
 * extracted `normalizeAgentId` and `selectTasks` helpers in the
 * dashboard's Zustand data-store.
 *
 * Background
 * ----------
 *
 * Three selectors in `conexus/dashboard/lib/stores/data-store.ts` --
 * `getAgentTasks`, `getAgentActions`, `getAgentTaskAnalysis` -- each
 * duplicated the same Admin/admin/strip-prefix dance plus the same
 * `t.assigned_to === ...` predicate inline. PR #130 fixed an overcount
 * bug ("completed tasks shown as assigned") on the Agents row but the
 * fix only landed in `agents-dashboard.tsx`; the same buggy filter
 * pattern in `data-store.ts` was unchanged. This PR refactors the
 * three selectors to compose two helpers so the next bug-fix can be
 * applied in one place.
 *
 * The dashboard ships no jsdom / RTL runtime tests, so these are
 * text-parse guards in the same style as the rest of this suite.
 * End-to-end behaviour is verified by `npm run build` (clean) and a
 * Firefox-MCP smoke pass documented on the PR.
 *
 * Ported from tests/test_dashboard_selector_helpers.py (Python source
 * tree retired).
