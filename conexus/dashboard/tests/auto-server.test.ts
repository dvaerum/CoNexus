/**
 * Regression guards for the dashboard path-prefix derivation.
 *
 * Originally these guarded the 3-useEffect bootstrap in
 * `api-client-initializer.tsx` (auto-seed + cold-start retry +
 * hydration-gate). Candidate C from the 2026-06-01 architecture review
 * collapsed that into:
 *
 *   - A module-level singleton in `lib/project-context.ts` that derives
 *     `{projectName, baseUrl, apiPrefix}` synchronously from
 *     `window.location.pathname` at import time (no useEffect, no
 *     zustand-persist hydration race).
 *   - Transparent retry inside `ApiClient.request()` on 502/503/504
 *     (no boundary-level setInterval poll).
 *
 * These guards check the new module. The "cold-start retry" guard moved
 * to the path-prefix-adapter guard (asserting the retry loop in
 * `lib/api.ts`), and the "hydration-gate" guard is gone — the new
 * derivation is synchronous and cannot race the persisted state.
