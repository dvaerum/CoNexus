/**
 * Regression guards: dashboard subscribes to MCP notifications on GET /mcp.
 *
 * Background
 * ----------
 *
 * PR #79 (Candidate A) wired session_registry into the transport, so
 * `notifications/resources/updated`, `notifications/prompts/list_changed`,
 * and `notifications/tools/list_changed` actually arrive on GET /mcp SSE
 * streams for the bearer's agent_id.
 *
 * Candidate E (this PR) wires the dashboard to subscribe. When a
 * notification arrives, the dashboard invalidates the relevant zustand
 * store slices so other tabs / the same tab see fresh data within seconds
 * instead of waiting up to 60s for the data-store auto-poll tick.
 *
 * URL plumbing
 * ------------
 *
 * The dashboard derives `projectName` from `window.location.pathname`
 * (`/conexus/__dashboard/<name>/...`) in `lib/project-context.ts`.
 * The MCP Streamable HTTP endpoint for that project lives at
 * `/conexus/<name>/mcp` — note this is NOT the `/__api/` REST prefix;
 * it's the router's MCP path served as the wrapped backend's `/mcp`.
 *
 * The `apiClient.createEventSource('/mcp')` helper would resolve to
 * `{baseUrl}/mcp` = `/conexus/__api/<name>/mcp` which the router does
 * not expose. We therefore build the MCP URL separately from `baseUrl`
 * (see `mcpUrlForProject()` in `lib/mcp-notifications.ts`).
 *
 * Auth
 * ----
 *
 * `EventSource` (the browser primitive) cannot send custom headers and
 * won't carry cookies cross-origin reliably, so the dashboard uses
 * `fetch` + a ReadableStream reader instead.
 *
 * Wave 2 (cleanup-wave-2, 2026-06-20) migrated the subscription off
 * bearer auth onto cookie auth. The fetch sends `credentials: "include"`;
 * the router's `backend_mcp_handler` validates the `conexus_session`
 * cookie + project membership and injects the project's admin token
 * upstream so the backend's `AuthHeaderMiddleware` (still bearer-only)
 * sees a valid bearer. No admin token ever lives in JS memory anymore.
 *
 * These tests are text-level (the fork has no jsdom/RTL infrastructure
 * for behavioural dashboard tests). Runtime is verified by `npm run
 * build` + the smoke test in the PR body.
