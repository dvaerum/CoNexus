"use client"

/**
 * TanStack Query hook for a project's membership list
 * (`GET /conexus/api/router/projects/<name>/memberships`).
 *
 * W6-followup-2 increment G2 (2026-08-11): project-memberships-modal used
 * to fetch via the hand-rolled `useRouterQuery` hook (with its
 * `enabled: open` gate and a `projectName` refetch dep). This module moves
 * the read onto the shared `queryClient`, keyed
 * `['project-memberships', projectName]` (see
 * `projectMembershipsQueryKey`). Router-level, so the second key segment
 * is the project NAME the modal was opened for, not the active project.
 *
 * The `enabled` gate is preserved so the query only fires while the dialog
 * is open (a closed modal must not fetch). Freshness after a membership
 * mutation rides an explicit `invalidateProjectMemberships(projectName)`
 * from each mutation's success handler (add / remove / change-role / undo)
 * — no SSE at the overview.
 *
 * The 403 "sysadmin only" outcome is NOT folded into a `forbidden` flag —
 * `useQuery` surfaces it as a thrown `ApiError` on `error`, and the
 * consumer derives `forbidden` from
 * `error instanceof ApiError && error.status === 403`.
