"use client"

/**
 * URL <-> active-section bridging hook.
 *
 * The dashboard's "current section" (Overview / Agents / Tasks /
 * Memories / Messages / Settings / Prompt Book) used to live only in
 * zustand state (`useDashboard.currentView`). That meant:
 *   - reload always reset to Overview, and
 *   - share-links could not deep-link into a specific section.
 *
 * This hook makes the URL the source of truth via `?page=<section>`,
 * e.g. `/conexus/app/<project>/?page=tasks`.
 *
 * Why query-param vs proper route segments. The dashboard is a single
 * client page that swaps a `currentView` enum — route segments would
 * require restructuring app/ into `app/[section]/page.tsx` files and
 * coordinating with the path-prefix adapter (PR #56) that mounts the
 * dashboard at `/conexus/app/<project>/`. Query-param is a
 * one-file change and works with the existing mount unchanged.
 *
 * Why a dedicated hook vs inlining useSearchParams in page.tsx. So
 * the sidebar Navigation component and page.tsx both go through the
 * same code path — same validation, same default fallback, same
 * setter semantics. The hook is the single source of truth for the
 * URL contract.
 *
 * Fallback. Missing `?page=` or unknown values fall back to
 * 'overview' so the bare dashboard URL keeps working.
