"use client"

/**
 * The single shared TanStack Query client for the whole dashboard.
 *
 * Wave 6 keystone increment 1 (2026-08-11): TanStack Query replaces the
 * hand-rolled `lib/stores/data-store.ts` server-cache for the `/all-data`
 * envelope. This client lives at MODULE scope (not created per-render)
 * for one load-bearing reason: non-React callers need to reach the same
 * cache the React tree reads. Specifically the operator-events SSE
 * dispatcher in `lib/mcp-notifications.ts` calls `invalidateAllData()`
 * below when a `resources/updated` notification arrives — a single
 * invalidation that refetches the one shared `['all-data', project]`
 * query, which is what closes ST-3 (double-sourcing) and ST-4
 * (split-brain live updates). A per-render `new QueryClient()` would give
 * the SSE dispatcher a different cache than the components render from.
 *
 * Defaults:
 *   - staleTime 30s mirrors the old data-store freshness gate, so a
 *     component remount inside the window reuses the cache instead of
 *     refetching.
 *   - refetchOnWindowFocus is OFF: the live-update SSE stream is the
 *     freshness driver; a focus refetch would just add redundant
 *     `/all-data` load (the exact pressure the store's 404-fallback
 *     cascade comment warns about).
 *   - retry is OFF: `ApiClient.request()` already does transparent
 *     exponential-backoff on 5xx (cold-start), so a second RQ retry
 *     layer would stack backoffs.
