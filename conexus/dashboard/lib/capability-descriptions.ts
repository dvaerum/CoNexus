/**
 * Single source of UI truth for capability descriptions.
 *
 * Wave 9 PR 5 (prancy-napping-pie) — every capability string the
 * dashboard surfaces (in the per-group "Capabilities" section under
 * the groups dashboard) needs a one-line human description so the
 * sysadmin understands what they're ticking. The canonical cap
 * vocabulary lives in ``conexus/core/capabilities.py`` —
 * ``KNOWN_CAPABILITIES`` — and that file is the source of truth.
 * This registry is the dashboard-side projection.
 *
 * Completeness is enforced at build time by
 * ``conexus/dashboard/tests/capability-descriptions-complete.test.ts``:
 *  * every member of ``KNOWN_CAPABILITIES`` must have a description;
 *  * every key in this registry must be a member of
 *    ``KNOWN_CAPABILITIES``.
 *
 * The dashboard UI groups capabilities by their first dotted segment
 * (``agents.*``, ``tasks.*``, ``memories.*``, etc.); the resource
 * label used in the collapsible section header is sourced from
 * :data:`CAPABILITY_RESOURCE_LABELS` below.
 */

/** Stable resource ordering — controls the order of collapsible
 *  sections in the dashboard. Sections render top-to-bottom in this
 *  order; capabilities whose first dotted segment isn't listed here
 *  fall to the end alphabetically (defensive — should never happen
 *  for a member of KNOWN_CAPABILITIES). */
