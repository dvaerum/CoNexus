/**
 * Column spec for the Agents table.
 *
 * Replaces the pre-scaffold `<CompactAgentRow>` (≈350 lines of hand-rolled
 * `<TableRow>` markup). The cells are byte-for-byte the same; what
 * changed is ownership — `<ResponsiveDataTable>` now renders the row
 * shell (`group` class, hover, row-click, the desktop/mobile twin
 * guard), and this module contributes only the per-cell content.
 *
 * Two cells keep their own component because they need hooks a plain
 * `cell: (row) => ReactNode` callback can't hold: `AgentTasksCell`
 * reads the data store, `AgentTokenCell` owns per-row "copied" state.

/**
 * Class list for the Agents `<table>` itself.
 *
 * Lives here, next to the column widths it depends on, because the two
 * are one decision: `min-w` must be at least the sum of the fixed
 * columns plus a usable floor for the elastic one, so a change to
 * either belongs in the same edit.
 *
 * `table-fixed` — a pathologically long value in ANY cell (a 5000-char
 * agent name was the live case, PR #588's predecessor) stretches an
 * auto-layout table thousands of px wide and pushes every other column
 * off-screen; measured 40,660px → 923px when this was added. Fixed
 * layout also makes the widths data-INdependent, so the columns don't
 * shuffle as rows come and go.
 *
 * `min-w-[56rem]` (896px) — the missing half of that decision. Under
 * fixed layout the elastic column absorbs the leftover, and when the
 * container is narrower than the fixed columns' sum that leftover goes
 * NEGATIVE: the browser clamps the column to 0px and its content paints
 * over the next one. Measured on a 1024×800 viewport (677px container,
 * over which the old columns' 720px sum forced the table wider and left
 * the elastic one nothing): AGENT 0px wide, 36 elements painting
 * outside their own `<td>` — the very defect #595 fixed, one
 * breakpoint down, because the wrapper had nothing to scroll.
 * The floor keeps every column at its minimum and lets the wrapper's
 * `overflow-x-auto` scroll instead — 688px of fixed columns + a 208px
 * AGENT floor. It sits below the 923px container a 1280 viewport gives,
 * so it costs nothing at the widths that already fit.
